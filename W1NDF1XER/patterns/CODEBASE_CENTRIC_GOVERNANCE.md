# Pattern: Codebase-Centric Governance

## Trigger
Any implementation work in P4NTHE0N directory.

## Pattern Description
WindFixer spends majority of time in P4NTHE0N directory, capturing learnings in real-time during implementation runs.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Pre-Implementation Discovery**
   - Recall relevant decisions from STR4TEG15T/decisions/
   - Consult knowledgebase from W1NDF1XER/knowledge/
   - Explore P4NTHE0N directory structure
   - Identify integration points

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Focus work in P4NTHE0N directory
   - Capture learnings in real-time
   - Document patterns as discovered
   - Update source reference map

3. **Learning Capture**
   - Write knowledge deltas to W1NDF1XER/knowledge/
   - Capture patterns to W1NDF1XER/patterns/
   - Update stack assimilation
   - Maintain deployment journal

4. **Post-Implementation**
   - Conduct Strategist audit
   - Update manifest with round tracking
   - Archive learning artifacts
   - Prepare for next implementation

## Success Metrics

- Time in P4NTHE0N directory: >80%
- Knowledge files created: 1+ per implementation
- Patterns captured: 1+ per implementation
- Deployment journals: 1 per decision

## Evidence Paths

- Deployment journals: W1NDF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_*
- Knowledge deltas: W1NDF1XER/knowledge/
- Pattern captures: W1NDF1XER/patterns/
- Source maps: W1NDF1XER/knowledge/SOURCE_REFERENCE_MAP.md

## Closure Rule

Do not close implementation without:
- Knowledge capture completed
- Patterns documented
- Deployment journal created
- Source reference map updated
