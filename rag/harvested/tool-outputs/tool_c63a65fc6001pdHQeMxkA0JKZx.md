Guard pre-checks:\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/guard.js --strict`\n2. Refresh working models:\n   - `bash skills/update-agent-models/test-models.sh`\n   - Agent execution note: this step is long-running; use a shell timeout of at least 420000 ms (7 minutes).\n3. Refresh OpenAI usage budget proposal:\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/openai-budget.js`\n4. Research missing benchmark coverage:\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/research-benchmarks.js`\n   - Default is one-model-at-a-time decision workflow\n   - Optional full sweep: `node skills/update-agent-models/research-benchmarks.js --batch`\n   - Optional targeted model: `node skills/update-agent-models/research-benchmarks.js --focus-model <provider/model>`\n5. Interview gate (required):\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/apply-auto-accepted.js`\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/next-interview.js`\n   - If exit code is 2, workflow is at the normal user decision gate for the current model\n   - If exit code is 3, workflow is at the normal research gate (gather more evidence before interviewing user)\n6. One-at-a-time continuation rule:\n   - If `remaining_after_scope > 0`, stop and rerun workflow for the next model\n7. Optimize chains:\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/optimize.js --strict --explain`\n8. Guard post-checks:\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/guard.js --strict`\n\nBy default, optimization runs in proposal mode (no direct config write).\nThere is no script apply mode.\n\n## One-Command Workflow\n\n- Full run:\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js`\n- Dry-run optimization path:\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --dry-run`\n- OpenAI-only fast path (budget-tier adjustment, skips research/interview):\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --openai-only`\n  - Trigger phrase: \"update agent models for OpenAI\" should always use this path.\n- Google-only fast path (Gemini quota/rate-limit adjustment, skips research/interview):\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --google-only`\n  - Trigger phrases: \"Update Gemini Agent Models\" or \"Update Google Agent Models\" should always use this path.\n- Keep latest N artifacts (default 5):\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --keep 5`\n- Skip model testing step (not recommended):\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --skip-model-refresh`\n- Force fresh benchmark research proposal:\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --refresh-research`\n- Apply optimized changes:\n  - Use an agent-reviewed edit step using the latest proposal file in `skills/update-agent-models/proposals/`.\n\n## Scripts\n\n- `optimize.js`\n  - Deterministically reorders each agent chain\n  - Updates both `agents.*.model` and `fallback.currentModels.*`\n  - Enforces constraints:\n    - `fixer` primary is `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`\n    - Anthropic is only allowed as `fixer` index 0 (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`)\n    - each role keeps at most one OpenAI model\n    - OpenAI model choice is tier-limited by budget stage (healthy -> medium -> low -> critical)\n    - as remaining usage decreases, lower-cost OpenAI tiers are preferred automatically\n    - scored models stay quality-sorted (index 0 highest score, except fixed fixer primary rule)\n    - chain tail is reserved bridge + local fallback: `free/openrouter/free`, then `lmstudio-local/*`\n  - Writes run report to `skills/update-agent-models/reports/`\n  - Writes proposal payload to `skills/update-agent-models/proposals/`\n  - Fails strict mode if any candidate model lacks benchmark coverage\n\n- `guard.js`\n  - Validates formulas, constants, role coverage, and schema assumptions\n  - Validates AA provider config exists in `opencode.json`\n  - Validates no legacy path drift and no hardcoded secrets in scripts\n  - Validates target config constraints\n\n- `test-models.sh`\n  - Reads keys from `C:\\Users\\paulc\\.local\\share\\opencode\\auth.json`\n  - Tests available provider models and writes a proposal file in `skills/update-agent-models/proposals/`\n  - This can take several minutes; agents should run it with a long command timeout (>= 420000 ms)\n  - Agent reviews and applies updates to `working_models.json`\n\n- `status.js`\n  - Prints current primaries and last run report pointer\n\n- `suggest-unmatched.js`\n  - Reads latest optimize report and emits unresolved model list for benchmark research workflow\n\n- `prune-artifacts.js`\n  - Prunes old backups/reports\n  - Also prunes old proposals\n\n- `openai-budget.js`\n  - Queries Codex App Server rate limits API in ChatGPT auth mode (`account/rateLimits/read`) when `codex app-server` is available\n  - Uses manual limits snapshot only if Codex rate-limits API is unavailable\n  - Does not use OpenAI usage API\n  - Reads 5-hour/weekly remaining percentages from `openai_limits_manual.json` (or CLI flags)\n  - Computes one budget health stage from separate 5-hour/weekly thresholds:\n    - critical: 5-hour <= 10% OR weekly <= 10%\n    - low: 5-hour <= 25% OR weekly <= 20%\n    - medium: 5-hour <= 50% OR weekly <= 30%\n    - otherwise healthy\n  - Provides remaining allowance context so optimizer can reduce OpenAI preference when budget is tight\n\n- `google-health.js`\n  - Tests Google models currently present in agent chains via Gemini API\n  - Detects quota-limited models and writes `google-health.*.json` proposal\n  - Provides Google health stage so optimizer can reduce or suppress unhealthy Google models quickly\n\n- `research-benchmarks.js`\n  - Detects missing benchmark coverage for pulled models\n  - Queries Artificial Analysis API (`/llms/models`) to research missing models\n  - Emits a benchmark research proposal requiring explicit user acceptance\n  - Runs one model at a time by default to support user review cadence\n  - If unresolved coverage remains, emits manual research tasks and fails\n\n- `next-interview.js`\n  - Reads latest benchmark research proposal\n  - Emits exactly one model decision prompt at a time\n  - Prints evidence package (sources + benchmark snapshot) for the current model\n  - If confidence is low, directs the agent to continue research before interviewing the user\n  - Emits a required agent playbook + response schema for the user-facing decision message\n  - Blocks workflow progression until user decision is recorded\n\n- `apply-auto-accepted.js`\n  - Syncs `autoAccepted=true` entries from latest benchmark research proposal into `benchmark_manual_accepted.json`\n  - Must run before optimization so accepted benchmark set is complete and auditable\n\nAcceptance gate:\n- High-confidence non-stealth mappings are auto-accepted from the latest research proposal.\n- Researched benchmark entries must be approved by user before being copied to `benchmark_manual_accepted.json`.\n- **NEVER auto-add models to `model_ignore_list.json` - explicit user approval is required first.**\n- The workflow will pause when user decisions are required. Do not proceed until the user has decided.\n- Scripts must not auto-add to `model_ignore_list.json`.\n- Agents must not ask generic \"how should we proceed\" prompts; they must present evidence and ask user to accept, deny, or provide guidance.\n\nInterview contract (required):\n- Research first, model-by-model (AA API -> web -> backend mapping if needed).\n- Present evidence bundle: sources, attempted queries, mapping hypothesis, proposed benchmarks/confidence.\n- Ask exactly one decision question: Approve, Deny, Ignore List, or Instructions.\n- Never summarize unresolved models as a bulk \"add all to ignore list\" recommendation.\n\n## Decision Choices\n- **Approve**: Accept researched benchmarks and add to `benchmark_manual_accepted.json`.\n- **Deny**: Skip the model for the current optimization run. This is handled via the `--deny <model>` CLI flag and is NOT stored permanently.\n- **Ignore List**: Permanently exclude the model by adding it to `model_ignore_list.json`.\n- **Instructions**: Provide manual values or general guidance.\n\n## Research Pipeline (API -> Web -> Rumor)\n\n`research-benchmarks.js` covers the AA API phase and produces a proposal with:\n- researched benchmark payloads (with confidence and auto-accept flag)\n- unresolved models + suggested web/rumor queries\n\nFor unresolved models, the agent must continue research in this order:\n\n1) Artificial Analysis API (script)\n   - `node skills/update-agent-models/research-benchmarks.js`\n\n2) Web search (agent)\n   - Use web search tools to find credible benchmark tables or official model specs.\n   - Capture URLs and extracted benchmark values into the next proposal, then interview user.\n\n3) Rumor mills / stealth mapping (agent)\n   - Only for stealth/cloaked models where the provider model ID does not map 1:1.\n   - Identify likely backing model using multiple credible sources.\n   - Present mapping + evidence and ask user to approve.\n\nIf benchmarks remain unknown after research:\n- user can approve adding model to `model_ignore_list.json` (agent can apply the approved edit).\n\nWorkflow efficiency rule:\n- `test-models.sh` runs every workflow execution to verify current model health and discover new models.\n- Use `--skip-model-refresh` only for debugging/local iteration where stale model health is acceptable.\n- If interview decisions are pending, workflow reuses latest research proposal and does not rerun research until decisions are resolved.\n- Use `--openai-only` when the request is specifically to adjust OpenAI model tiering from usage/rate limits.\n- Use `--google-only` when the request is specifically to mitigate Gemini per-model quota/rate-limit issues.\n\n## Optimize Options\n\n- `--dry-run` no write\n- `--strict` fail on unscored chains or any missing benchmark coverage\n- `--explain` print top scoring models per agent\n- `--no-backup` skip backup creation\n- `--no-report` skip report output\n\n### One-time benchmark proxies\n\nIf you want to temporarily inject a benchmark value derived from a proxy algorithm (without treating it as “real research”), use a **one-time proxy proposal**:\n\nResearch-first rule:\n- Proxies are only allowed after running the benchmark research workflow.\n- A proxy may only cover models that appear in the **latest** `benchmark-research.*.json` proposal (pending/unresolved coverage).\n\n- Create a proposal file under `skills/update-agent-models/proposals/` named `benchmark-proxy.<timestamp>.json`\n  - The file must include `one_time=true`.\n  - See template: `skills/update-agent-models/proposals/benchmark-proxy.example.jsonc`\n- Run optimization with:\n  - `node skills/update-agent-models/optimize.js --strict --explain --use-proxy`\n  - or `node skills/update-agent-models/run-workflow.js --use-proxy`\n\nSafety guarantees:\n- Proxy proposals are applied **in-memory only** during scoring.\n- They are **not** copied into `model_benchmarks.json` or `benchmark_manual_accepted.json`.\n- After a successful run, the proxy proposal is automatically renamed to `consumed.*.benchmark-proxy.*.json` so it cannot be reused accidentally.\n\n## Keys and Provider Configuration\n\n- API keys are read from:\n  - `C:\\Users\\paulc\\.local\\share\\opencode\\auth.json`\n- Artificial Analysis provider should be configured in:\n  - `C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\opencode.json`\n  - Use env ref: `{env:ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_API_KEY}`\n\n### Manual Benchmark Runs (IFBench, MMLU-Pro, GPQA)\n\nSome providers/models do not publish academic benchmark results. In that case we run the benchmarks ourselves and then record the resulting metric via the normal acceptance workflow.\n\n#### IFBench\n- Runner scaffold: `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/ifbench/ifbench-platform/`\n- Instructions: `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/ifbench/instructions.md`\n\n#### MMLU-Pro\n- Runner scaffold: `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/mmlu_pro/mmlu-pro-platform/`\n- Instructions: `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/mmlu_pro/openrouter_mmlu_pro_lm_eval_instructions.md`\n\n#### GPQA\n- Runner scaffold: `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/gpqa/gpqa-platform/`\n- Instructions: `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/gpqa/gpqa_openrouter_install.md`\n\n#### Setup & Keys\n- **Shared Vendor**: All platforms share a vendored `lm-evaluation-harness` at `skills/update-agent-models/benchmarks/vendor/lm-evaluation-harness/`.\n- **API Keys**: Provide keys at runtime via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (preferred) or `API_KEY`.\n- **GPQA Gated Access**: Requires `HF_TOKEN` and accepting terms on Hugging Face.\n- **Venvs**: Each platform has a dedicated `.venv/` for isolation.\n\nDo not commit keys; keep them in your environment (or local `.env` that is gitignored).\n\n## Maintenance Rules\n\n- If algorithms change, update `bench_calc.json` and rerun full workflow.\n- Keep role weights summing to `1.0`.\n- Keep formulas normalized using constants for mixed metric scales.\n- Never manually reorder chains in `oh-my-opencode-theseus.json`.\n\nBase directory for this skill: file:///C:/Users/paulc/.config/opencode/skills/update-agent-models\nRelative paths in this skill (e.g., scripts/, reference/) are relative to this base directory.\nNote: file list is sampled.\n\n<skill_files>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\working_models.json</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\test-models.sh</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\suggest-unmatched.js</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\status.js</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\run-workflow.js</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\research_gripes.md</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\research-benchmarks.js</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\reports\\optimize.2026-02-15T18-57-30-232Z.json</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\reports\\optimize.2026-02-15T11-55-55-959Z.json</file>\n<file>C:\\Users\\paulc\\.config\\opencode\\skills\\update-agent-models\\reports\\optimize.2026-02-15T11-55-19-396Z.json</file>\n</skill_files>\n</skill_content>"}}}]},{"role":"model","parts":[{"text":"Perfect!
