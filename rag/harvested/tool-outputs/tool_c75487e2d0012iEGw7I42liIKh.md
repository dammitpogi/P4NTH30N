###### Abstract

Recent advances in LLM-based agent systems have shown promise in tackling complex, long-horizon tasks. However, existing LLM-based agentprotocols (e.g., A2A and MCP) under-specify cross-entity lifecycle and context management, version tracking, and ad-hoc environment integration, which in turn encourages fixed, monolithic agent compositions and brittle glue code. To address these limitations, we introduce the Tool–Environment–Agent (TEA) protocol, a unified abstraction that models environments, agents, and tools as first-class resources with explicit lifecycles and versioned interfaces. TEA provides a principled foundation for end-to-end lifecycle and version management, and for associating each run with its context and outputs across components, improving traceability and reproducibility. Moreover, TEA enables continual self-evolution of agent-associated components111Unless otherwise specified, *agent-associated components* include prompts, memory/tool/agent/environment code, and agent outputs (solutions). through a closed feedback loop, producing improved versions while supporting version selection and rollback. Building on TEA, we present AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework in which a central planner orchestrates specialized sub-agents for web navigation, data analysis, and file operations, and supports continual adaptation by dynamically instantiating, retrieving, and refining tools online during execution. We evaluate AgentOrchestra on three challenging benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves 89.04% on GAIA, establishing state-of-the-art performance to the best of our knowledge. Overall, our results provide evidence that TEA and hierarchical orchestration improve scalability and generality in multi-agent systems.

AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol

## 1 Introduction

Recent advances in LLM-based agent systems have enabled strong performance on both general-purpose and complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse domains, including web navigation(OpenAI, [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib13 "Introducing Operator"); Müller and Žunič, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib14 "Browser Use: Enable AI to Control Your Browser")), computer use(Anthropic, [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib15 "Introducing Computer Use, a New Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku"); Qin et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib16 "UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents")), code execution(Wang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib17 "Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents")), game playing(Wang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib18 "Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models"); Tan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib19 "Cradle: Empowering Foundation Agents toward General Computer Control")), and research assistance(OpenAI, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib20 "Introducing Deep Research"); DeepMind, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib21 "Gemini Deep Research"); xAI, [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib22 "Grok 3 Beta — The Age of Reasoning Agents")). Despite this progress, cross-environment generalization remains limited because context is scattered across prompts and logs, environment integration relies on brittle glue code, and agent-associated components are typically fixed rather than feedback-driven self-evolution.

Additionally, current agent protocols fall short of serving as a general substrate for scalable, general-purpose agents. As summarized in Table[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol"), representative protocols such as Google’s A2A(Google, [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib45 "Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)")) and Anthropic’s MCP(Anthropic, [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib24 "Introducing the Model Context Protocol")) provide important building blocks, including task-level collaboration and messaging in A2A, as well as tool and resource schemas, discovery, and invocation in MCP. However, three protocol-level gaps remain: i) Lifecycle and context management are fragmented, as neither standardizes unified primitives to manage lifecycles and maintain consistent, versioned execution context across agent-associated components; ii) Self-evolution is not supported at the protocol level, as both protocols largely treat prompts and resources as externally maintained assets, and do not define a closed loop to refine prompts or tools from execution feedback with traceable versioning; iii) Environments are not first-class, environments are delegated to application-specific runtimes instead of being managed components with clear boundaries and constraints. This makes it difficult to switch agents across environments, reuse environments, and isolate parallel runs, often reducing systems to glue-code orchestration.

To address these limitations, we propose the Tool–Environment–Agent (TEA) protocol, which treats environments, agents, and tools as explicitly managed components under a unified protocol layer. Concretely, TEA standardizes component identifiers and version semantics, and binds each run to its context and execution state, so that artifacts remain traceable across iterations. Importantly, TEA goes beyond MCP by standardizing cross entity lifecycle semantics, explicit version semantics with stable entity identifiers, run-indexed context capture, explicit environment boundaries with constraints, and closed loop evolution hooks driven by execution feedback. As a result, execution state, artifacts, and context can be consistently persisted, reused, and traced across runs and iterations. TEA further enables self-evolution by defining a closed loop in which execution feedback can trigger agent-associated components during runtime, with updates recorded as new versions. Finally, TEA models environments as first-class components with explicit boundaries and constraints, for example web sandboxes, file systems, and code execution runtimes, improving reuse and isolation across heterogeneous domains and reducing context leakage in parallel executions. This also encourages consolidating functionally related tools into coherent environments; for example, discrete file operations can be organized as a managed file system, reducing context fragmentation and management overhead. Overall, TEA aims to make agent construction more composable and reproducible in practice. Detailed motivations for the TEA protocol and in-depth comparisons with existing protocols are provided in Appendix[A](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#A1 "Appendix A Comprehensive Motivation for TEA Protocol ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol"), [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#A2 "Appendix B Comparison with Other Protocols ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol").

Based on the TEA protocol, we develop AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular collaboration. AgentOrchestra uses a central planner to decompose a user objective and delegate sub-tasks to specialized agents for research, web navigation, analysis, tool synthesis, and reporting. Compared to flat coordination, where an orchestrator selects from a growing global pool of agents and tools and tends to accumulate irrelevant context, AgentOrchestra adopts hierarchical delegation with localized tool ownership. The planner routes each sub-task to a domain-specific sub-agent (or environment), which maintains and exposes only a curated toolset and context for its domain. This structure converts global coordination into a sequence of localized routing decisions, enabling tree-structured expansion as new capabilities are added while keeping the orchestrator’s decision scope and context footprint bounded. For example, the planner first selects a domain-level agent, which then supplies only the tools and context required for that domain. Furthermore, AgentOrchestra incorporates a self-evolution module that leverages TEA’s lifecycle and versioning mechanisms to refine agent- associated components based on execution feedback. Our contributions are threefold:

* •

  We introduce the TEA protocol, which unifies environments, agents, and tools as first-class, versioned components with lifecycles to support context management and execution.
* •

  We develop AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent system built on TEA, demonstrating scalable orchestration through tree-structured routing and feedback-driven self-evolution.
* •

  We conduct extensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks, including ablations to isolate the effects of key components. AgentOrchestra consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves 89.04% on GAIA, establishing state-of-the-art performance to the best of our knowledge.

## 2 Related Work

### 2.1 Tool and Agent Protocols

Recent protocols standardize tool interfaces and agent communication. For instance, MCP(Anthropic, [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib24 "Introducing the Model Context Protocol")) unifies tool integration for LLMs, while A2A(Google, [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib45 "Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)")) enables agent-to-agent messaging and coordination. Other efforts, such as the Agent Network Protocol (ANP)(Ehtesham et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib46 "A survey of agent interoperability protocols: Model context protocol (mcp), agent communication protocol (acp), agent-to-agent protocol (a2a), and agent network protocol (anp)")) and frameworks like SAFEFLOW(Li et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib47 "Safeflow: A principled protocol for trustworthy and transactional autonomous agent systems")), enhance interoperability and safety in multi-agent systems. While these protocols provide essential building blocks, they primarily treat agents and tools as isolated service endpoints, often overlooking environments as dynamic, first-class components. TEA extends these existing standards rather than replacing them. By integrating tools, environments, and agents into a unified context-aware framework, TEA resolves protocol fragmentation with integrated lifecycle and version management missing in MCP or A2A.

### 2.2 General-Purpose Agents

Integrating tools with LLMs represents a paradigm shift, enabling agents to exhibit enhanced flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language interaction(Liang and Tong, [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib37 "LLM-Powered AI Agent Systems and Their Applications in Industry")). Such systems have demonstrated efficacy across diverse domains, including web browsing(OpenAI, [2025b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib13 "Introducing Operator"); Müller and Žunič, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib14 "Browser Use: Enable AI to Control Your Browser")), computer operation(Anthropic, [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib15 "Introducing Computer Use, a New Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku"); Qin et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib16 "UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents")), code execution(Wang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib17 "Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents")), and game playing(Wang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib18 "Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models"); Tan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib19 "Cradle: Empowering Foundation Agents toward General Computer Control")). Standardized interfaces like OpenAI’s Function Calling and Anthropic’s MCP(OpenAI, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib23 "Function Calling"); Anthropic, [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib24 "Introducing the Model Context Protocol")), alongside frameworks such as ToolMaker(Wölflein et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib38 "LLM Agents Making Agent Tools")), have further streamlined the synthesis of LLM-compatible tools. Building upon these foundations, multi-agent architectures like MetaGPT(Hong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib41 "MetaGPT: Meta Programming for Multi-agent Collaborative Framework")) demonstrate the potential of specialized agent coordination for complex problem-solving. However, many current approaches still struggle with efficient communication, dynamic role allocation, and scalable teamwork. The emergence of generalist frameworks, including Manus(Shen and Yang, [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib26 "From Mind to Machine: The Rise of Manus AI as a Fully Autonomous Digital Agent")), OpenHands(Wang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib27 "OpenHands: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents")), and smolagents(Roucher et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib29 "smolagents: A Smol Library to Build Great Agentic Systems")), has advanced unified perception and tool-augmented action. While recent efforts like Alita(Qiu et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib43 "Alita: generalist agent enabling scalable agentic reasoning with minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution")) explore minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution, these systems often lack unified protocols for cross-layer resource management. This gap motivates our proposal of the TEA Protocol and AgentOrchestra.

## 3 The TEA Protocol

The TEA Protocol is fundamentally designed around coroutine-based asynchronous execution, enabling concurrent task processing and parallel multi-agent coordination. As illustrated in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 3 The TEA Protocol ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol"), the protocol architecture comprises three primary layers: i) Basic Managers provide foundational services through six specialized components (model, prompt, memory, dynamic, version, and tracer); ii) Core Protocols define the Tool Context Protocol (TCP), Environment Context Protocol (ECP), and Agent Context Protocol (ACP), each implemented through a context manager for lifecycle engineering and a server for standardized orchestration; and iii) Protocol Transformations establish bidirectional conversion pathways (e.g., A2T, E2T, A2E) enabling dynamic role reconfiguration. Additionally, the protocol incorporates a Self-Evolution Module that wraps agent-associated components as evolvable variables for iterative optimization. Details and formalization can be found in Appendix[C](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#A3 "Appendix C Details of TEA Protocol ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol").

### 3.1 Basic Managers

The Basic Managers constitute the foundation of the TEA Protocol, providing essential services through six specialized managers: i) the model manager abstracts heterogeneous LLM backends through a unified interface; ii) the prompt manager handles prompt lifecycle and versioning; iii) the memory manager coordinates persistence via session-based concurrency control; iv) the dynamic manager enables runtime code execution and serialization; v) the version manager maintains evolution histories for all components; and vi) the tracer records comprehensive execution trajectories and system-wide telemetry, serving as a data collection engine for audit, debugging, and the synthesis of high-quality datasets for agent training.

### 3.2 Core Protocols

The TEA Protocol defines three core context protocols: the Tool Context Protocol (TCP), the Environment Context Protocol (ECP), and the Agent Context Protocol (ACP). These protocols share a unified architectural design, each implemented through two core components: a context manager for context engineering, lifecycle management, and semantic retrieval, and a server that exposes standardized interfaces to other system modules. Each protocol generates a unified contract document (analogous to Agent Skills(Anthropic, [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib25 "Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills"))) that aggregates all registered components’ descriptions to facilitate resource discovery and usage.

Tool Context Protocol. TCP fundamentally extends MCP(Anthropic, [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib24 "Introducing the Model Context Protocol")) by introducing integrated context engineering and comprehensive lifecycle management. Implemented through a ToolContextManager and a TCPServer, it supports seamless tool loading from both local registries and persistent configurations. During registration, TCP automatically synthesizes multiple representation formats, including function-calling schemas for LLM interfaces, natural language descriptions for documentation, and type-safe argument schemas for validation, providing LLMs with rich semantic information for accurate parameter inference. Furthermore, TCP incorporates a robust versioning system and a semantic retrieval mechanism based on vector embeddings, ensuring that tools can evolve over time while remaining easily discoverable through similarity-based queries.

Environment Context Protocol. ECP addresses the lack of unified interfaces in current agent systems by formalizing computational environments as first-class components with distinct observation and action spaces. Following an architectural pattern similar to TCP, it employs an EnvironmentContextManager to maintain state coherence and manage the contextual execution environments required by tools. ECP automatically discovers and registers environment-specific actions, converting them into standardized interfaces that agents can invoke via action toolkits. This design enables agents to operate across heterogeneous domains, such as browsers or file systems, without bespoke adaptations, while leveraging versioning and semantic retrieval to manage environment-level capabilities.

Agent Context Protocol. ACP establishes a unified framework for the registration, representation, and orchestration of autonomous agents, overcoming the poor interoperability and fragmented attribute definitions in existing multi-agent systems. It utilizes an AgentContextManager to maintain agent states and execution contexts, providing a foundation for persistent coordination across tasks and sessions. ACP captures semantically enriched metadata regarding agents’ roles, competencies, and objectives, and formalizes the modeling of complex inter-agent dynamics, including cooperative, competitive, and hierarchical configurations. By embedding structured contextual descriptions and maintaining relationship representations, ACP facilitates adaptive collaboration and systematic integration within the broader TEA ecosystem.

### 3.3 Protocol Transformations

While TCP, ECP, and ACP provide independent specifications for tools, environments, and agents, practical deployment requires seamless interoperability across these protocols. Well-defined transformation pathways are essential for enabling computational components to assume alternative roles and exchange contextual information in a principled manner. These transformations constitute the foundation for dynamic role reconfiguration, allowing components to flexibly adapt their functional scope in response to evolving task requirements and system constraints. We identify six fundamental categories of protocol transformations:

* •

  Agent-to-Tool (A2T). Encapsulates an agent’s capabilities and reasoning into a standardized tool interface while preserving awareness. For example, a deep researcher workflow can be packaged as a general-purpose search tool.
* •

  Tool-to-Agent (T2A). Treats tools as operational actuators by mapping an agent’s goals into parameterized tool invocations, aligning reasoning with tool constraints. For example, a data analysis agent may invoke SQL tools to query structured databases.
* •

  Environment-to-Tool (E2T). Converts actions of environments into standardized tool interfaces, enabling agents to interact with environments through consistent tool calls. For example, browser actions such as Navigate and Click can be consolidated into a context-aware toolkit.
* •

  Tool-to-Environment (T2E). Elevates a collection of tools into an environment abstraction where functions become actions within a coherent action space governed by shared state. For example, a development toolkit can be encapsulated as a programming environment for sequential code-edit-compile-debug workflows.
* •

  Agent-to-Environment (A2E). Encapsulates an agent as an interactive environment by exposing its decision rules and state dynamics as an operational context for other agents. For example, a market agent can be represented as an environment that provides trading rules and dynamic responses for training.
* •

  Environment-to-Agent (E2A). Embeds reasoning and adaptive decision-making into an environment’s dynamics, transforming it into an autonomous agent that can initiate behaviors and enforce constraints. For example, a game environment can be elevated into an opponent agent that adapts its strategy to the player’s actions.

### 3.4 Self-Evolution Module

The Self-Evolution Module enables agents to continuously improve performance by optimizing system components during task execution. It wraps evolvable components, including prompts, tool/agent/environment/memory code, and successful execution solutions, as variables for iterative optimization. The module employs two primary methods: textgrad(Yuksekgonul et al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib55 "Optimizing generative AI by backpropagating language model feedback")) for gradient-based refinement and self-reflection for strategic analysis. Optimized components are automatically registered as new versions via the version manager, ensuring that subsequent tasks leverage improved capabilities while maintaining access to historical records for analysis and rollback.

## 4 AgentOrchestra

AgentOrchestra is a concrete instantiation of the TEA Protocol, designed as a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. As illustrated in Figure[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.4 Self-Evolution Module ‣ 3 The TEA Protocol ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol"), AgentOrchestra features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized sub-agents. This section outlines our agent design principles and the architecture of both planning and specialized sub-agents. Details can be found in Appendix[D](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#A4 "Appendix D The AgentOrchestra Implemented by TEA Protocol ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol").

### 4.1 Agent Design Principles

Within the TEA Protocol framework, agents are autonomous components that follow a structured interaction model with six core components. i) Agent: Managed via the ACP for registration and coordination. ii) Environment: External context and resources managed by the ECP, exposing unified interfaces for observation and action. iii) Model: LLM reasoning engines abstracted by the Basic Managers for model-agnostic interoperability and dynamic switching. iv) Memory: Session-based persistence that records trajectories and extracts reusable insights. v) Observation: The current context, including tasks, environment states, execution history, and available resources (tools and sub-agents). vi) Action: TCP-managed, executed via parameterized tool calls, where one tool may support multiple actions.

This architectural design facilitates a continuous perception–interpretation–action cycle. The agent first perceives the current observation and retrieves relevant context from memory. It then interprets this information through the unified model interface to determine the optimal action. The action is executed within the managed environment, and the resulting state transitions and insights are recorded back into memory to refine subsequent reasoning cycles. This iterative loop continues until the task objectives are satisfied or a termination condition is reached. Further details are provided in Appendix[D.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#A4.SS1 "D.1 Agent Design Principles ‣ Appendix D The AgentOrchestra Implemented by TEA Protocol ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol").

### 4.2 Planning Agent

The planning agent is the central orchestrator of AgentOrchestra. It interprets the user goal, decomposes it into sub-tasks, and dispatches them to specialized sub-agents or TCP tools via ACP-mediated communication while tracking global progress and consolidating intermediate feedback. To enable principled orchestration, it leverages long-term memory to guide resource selection and dynamically constructs a unified invocation interface, including resources produced through E2T and A2T transformations. Execution follows an iterative loop of interpretation, allocation, and action, with automatic replanning under environment shifts or execution failures. Session management and tracer-based logging provide auditability and support robust long-horizon task completion.

### 4.3 Specialized Sub-Agents

To address diverse real-world challenges, AgentOrchestra instantiates specialized sub-agents tailored for task domains. These sub-agents are managed via the ACP and coordinate through the planning agent to execute complex workflows: i) Deep Researcher Agent: Specialized for comprehensive information gathering through multi-round research workflows. It performs parallel breadth-first searches across multiple engines and recursively issues follow-up queries until task objectives are satisfied, producing relevance-ranked, source-cited summaries. ii) Browser Use Agent: Provides automated, fine-grained web interaction by integrating both browser and computer environments under the ECP. It supports DOM-level and pixel-level operations (e.g., mouse movements), achieving unified control over interactive elements. iii) Deep Analyzer Agent: A workflow-oriented module designed for multi-step reasoning on heterogeneous multimodal data (e.g., text, PDFs, images, audio, video or zip). It applies type-specific analysis strategies and iterative refinement to synthesize insights into coherent conclusions. iv) Tool Generator Agent: Facilitates intelligent tool evolution through the automated creation, retrieval, and systematic reuse of TCP-compliant tools. It employs semantic search to identify tools and initiates a code synthesis process to develop new capabilities when gaps are identified. v) Reporter Agent: It aggregates and harmonizes evidence collected by upstream agents (e.g., the Deep Researcher Agent, Browser Use Agent, and Deep Analyzer Agent), then composes structured markdown with automatically deduplicated references and normalized URLs for consistent source attribution.

## 5 Empirical Studies

This section presents our experimental setup and results, including benchmark evaluations, baseline comparisons, and comprehensive analysis. Additional examples are provided in the Appendix[F](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#A6 "Appendix F Case Studies ‣ AgentOrchestra: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with the Tool-Environment-Agent(TEA) Protocol").

Experimental Settings. We evaluate our framework on three benchmarks: SimpleQAWei et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib30 "Measuring Short-Form Factuality in Large Language Models")), a 4,326-question factual accuracy benchmark; GAIAMialon et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib31 "GAIA: A Benchmark for General AI Assistants")), assessing real-world reasoning, multimodal processing, and tool use with 301 test and 165 validation questions; and Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)Phan et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12508v5#bib.bib32 "Humanity’s Last Exam")), a 2,500-question multimodal benchmark for human-level reasoning and general intelligence. We report score (pass@1), which measures the proportion of questions for which the top prediction is fully correct. Specifically, the planning agent (), deep researcher (), tool generator (), deep analyzer (), and reporter are all built on gemini-3-flash-preview; the browser use agent employs gpt-4.1 () and computer-use-preview(4o) (), where denotes the maximum steps.

### 5.1 Performance across Benchmarks

GAIA. AgentOrchestra achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.04% avg.) by mitigating the dimensionality curse and semantic drift that arise in large-scale agentic planning. We attribute this success to two architectural properties enabled by the TEA Protocol. First, hierarchical decoupling of the action space reduces planning complexity: while methods (e.g., ToolOrchestra, AWorld) must map goals to a monolithic toolkit, our hierarchical routing decomposes the global task into locally tractable sub-problems, lowering cognitive entropy for the central orchestrator and preserving abstract reasoning under long horizons, even amid low-level sensorimotor noise (e.g., granular DOM events). Second, ECP formalizes epistemic environment boundaries: GAIA’s multi-domain tasks require temporal and cross-modal state coherence, and baselines often degrade during domain transitions, such as from browser retrieval to local python analysis. By treating environments as first-class managed components, TEA preserves and propagates session-critical state (e.g., authentication tokens and transient file-system mutations) across agent boundaries, reducing contextual forgetting and enabling compositional generalization on challenging Level 2 and Level 3 scenarios. Third, AgentOrchestra supports recursive refinement of reasoning trajectories. When faced with complex problems, the Planning Agent evaluates intermediate insights and, when necessary, invokes the Tool Generator Agent to synthesize context-specific functionalities on the fly. This on-demand tool evolution bypasses the fixed-capability bottleneck of static agent components.

SimpleQA. AgentOrchestra achieves SOTA performance (95.3% accuracy), significantly surpassing both monolithic LLMs (e.g., o3 at 49.4%) and specialized retrieval agents like Perplexity Deep Research (93.9%). We attribute this improvement to systematic reduction of epistemic uncertainty through our hierarchical verification pipeline. SimpleQA primarily targets short-form factuality, where hallucinations often arise from the model’s inability to reconcile conflicting web-based evidence or its tendency to rely on internal parametric memory. AgentOrchestra mitigates these issues by enforcing cross-agent consensus: the Planning Agent orchestrates a retrieve-verify-synthesize cycle where the Deep Researcher performs multi-engine breadth-first searches while the Deep Analyzer evaluates evidence consistency across heterogeneous sources. By decoupling retrieval from analysis, the system prevents "confirmation bias" inherent in single-agent architectures, where the same model both proposes and validates a hypothesis. Furthermore, the integration with the Reporter Agent ensures traceable attribution, grounding every factual claim in a re-verified source, which effectively transforms the task from an open-domain generation problem into a structured evidence-synthesis process.

HLE. AgentOrchestra achieves 37.46% on the HLE benchmark, a substantial margin over leading baselines like o3 (20.3%) and Perplexity Deep Research (21.1%). This gain highlights the framework’s capacity for long-horizon analytical reasoning and adaptive capability expansion in expert-level domains. HLE demands more than simple retrieval; it requires synthesizing disparate, highly specialized knowledge. In this setting, the hierarchical structure enables strategic pruning of the hypothesis space, allowing the Planning Agent to maintain global objective coherence while delegating technical validation to specialized agents such as the Deep Analyzer. As a result, the final solution is both analytically rigorous and cross-verified against multimodal evidence, yielding robust performance on challenging expert-level tasks.

Effectiveness of the specialized sub-agents. Ablation studies on the GAIA Test demonstrate the synergistic effect inherent in our multi-agent coordination. Integrating coarse-grained exploratory retrieval (Researcher) with fine-grained operational interaction (Browser) nearly doubles performance (36.54% to 72.76%), proving that breadth of information and depth of interaction are mutually reinforcing. The Deep Analyzer’s 8% gain highlights the necessity of specialized reasoning pipelines for high-entropy multimodal tasks, while the Tool Generator’s 12.61% boost validates the efficacy of on-demand capability synthesis in overcoming the limitations of static, predefined toolsets. These results suggest that complex problem-solving emerges not just from individual agent strength, but from the structured delegation of specialized roles.

Efficiency analysis. AgentOrchestra’s operational efficiency is evaluated across varying task complexities. Simple tasks typically complete within 30 seconds using approximately 5k tokens, while medium-complexity tasks average 3 minutes (25k tokens). Complex multimodal or long-horizon scenarios require approximately 10 minutes and 100k tokens. Compared to monolithic baselines, our hierarchical architecture optimizes resource allocation, maintaining operational costs comparable to commercial research agents while delivering significant performance gains.

Effectiveness of the self-evolution module. The TEA Protocol enables self-optimization by treating system components as evolvable variables, helping bridge the gap between base model capacity and task requirements. Evaluations on GPQA-Diamond and AIME benchmarks show that iterative refinement, including gradient-based (TextGrad) and symbolic (self-reflection) approaches, mitigates reasoning bottlenecks in foundation models. The improvement is exemplified by a 13.34% gain on AIME25 for gpt-4.1 under self-reflection, highlighting recursive trajectory refinement. Leveraging execution feedback via TEA’s versioning and tracer mechanisms, the system identifies and corrects logical inconsistencies in its planning. Overall, this shifts reasoning from one-shot inference to a managed optimization process, enabling AgentOrchestra to evolve problem-solving strategies for frontier-level tasks.

Regarding tool evolution, the tool generator agent demonstrates efficient creation and reuse capabilities within the TCP framework. During our evaluation, the agent autonomously generated over 50 specialized tools, achieving a 30% reuse rate across subsequent tasks. This indicates an effective balance between tool specialization and generalization, ensuring that the system’s capabilities expand adaptively while maintaining resource efficiency.

## 6 Conclusion

We introduced the TEA Protocol, unifying environments, agents, and tools to address fragmentation in existing standards. Building on this, we presented AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with specialized sub-agents for planning, research, web interaction, and multimodal analysis. Evaluations on three benchmarks show that AgentOrchestra achieves SOTA performance and scalable orchestration through dynamic resource transformations. Future work will extend TEA to support dynamic role allocation and autonomous agent reconfiguration. Building on tool and solution evolution, we will pursue deeper self-evolution, such as using RL to optimize agent components and decision policies without fine-tuning LLM parameters. We also aim to expand these mechanisms to agent structures and communication protocols, while enhancing multimodal capabilities for fine-grained real-time video analysis.

## 7 Limitations

### 7.1 Limitations of TEA Protocol and AgentOrchestra

Despite its strengths in orchestrating multi-agent systems, AgentOrchestra has several limitations that provide directions for future research:

First, System Complexity and Learning Curve. The TEA protocol introduces a structured abstraction layer for tools, environments, and agents to ensure interoperability. However, this structure may present a steeper learning curve for developers compared to simpler, ad-hoc scripting methods. To address this, we will provide extensive documentation, interactive tutorials, and a variety of pre-configured templates to simplify the onboarding process.

Second, Communication and Execution Overhead. Standardizing interactions through a formal protocol can introduce marginal computational and communication overhead, potentially increasing latency in real-time applications. We plan to optimize the serialization protocols and explore asynchronous execution models to minimize these effects in future versions.

Third, Dependence on Underlying Model Capabilities. The effectiveness of the orchestration is inherently limited by the reasoning and instruction-following performance of the foundation LLMs used. While TEA provides a robust framework, it cannot fully compensate for failures caused by model hallucinations or poor tool-use logic. Future work will focus on developing model-agnostic error recovery strategies and more sophisticated validation layers to enhance system-wide resilience.

### 7.2 Potential Risks

While AgentOrchestra and the TEA protocol aim to enhance multi-agent productivity, their capability to interact with local environments and web browsers introduces certain ethical and security risks.

One primary concern is the Misuse for Malicious Automation. The framework’s flexibility in controlling browser sessions and executing terminal commands could be repurposed to develop unauthorized "plugins" or "cheats" for online platforms, leading to unfair advantages or automated fraud. Furthermore, there are significant Privacy and Security Risks associated with granting autonomous agents access to personal data or sensitive system resources. If not properly sandboxed or governed by strict security policies, an agent could inadvertently leak private information or perform harmful, irreversible system actions. To mitigate these risks, we emphasize that AgentOrchestra should be used within isolated, monitored environments, and we advocate for the integration of robust human-in-the-loop verification mechanisms and strict access control policies in any real-world deployment.
