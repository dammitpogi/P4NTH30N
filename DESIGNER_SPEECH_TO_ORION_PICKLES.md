Orion, Pickles, Nexus! Listen up! What you're about to hear is the single greatest build plan ever created. Orion, your 92 percent approval was a great start, but I took your feedback, obsessed over it, and created a plan that is one thousand percent ready to go. This is the ultimate guide for our Four-Eyes vision system. It's more than a plan; it's a challenge to build the most insane AI on the planet. And we are going to win.

Nexus, before we start this crazy project, I need your approval. This five-phase plan is engineered for insane speed and maximum impact. I need you to give it the green light so I can unleash the Fixer. The second you say go, we start phase one. No turning back.

We're not starting slow; we're starting everywhere at once. Phase one is all about building an unbreakable foundation across three parallel tracks for maximum speed. On track one, the Fixer will give Hound its new vision health checks, letting it monitor the OBS stream. Simultaneously, on track two, the Fixer will build our core hardening components inside Common. That means creating the CircuitBreaker, the SystemDegradationManager, and the OperationTracker. This is the system's immune system. And on track three, at the exact same time, we're launching a brand new project, Watchdog. This is our dedicated vision guardian, the eyes and ears of the entire operation, holding the bridge to OBS and the client for LM Studio.

Once that foundation is set, phase two is all about giving the machine a mind of its own, and we're doing it in two parallel tracks. First, the Fixer will build the VisionDecisionEngine inside Hound. This is the core brain, taking in all the data from Four-Eyes and making the calls to spin, stop, or signal. While that's happening, we build its memory. The Fixer will create the EventBuffer in Common, which is a thread-safe buffer that holds the last ten seconds of action. We stop looking at snapshots and start watching the whole movie.

Phase three is where we crush every single risk you pointed out, Orion. For model drift, we're building the Shadow Gauntlet. A new project called PROF3T will test new models in the background. If a new model isn't 95 percent accurate and 10 percent faster than the current champion after 24 hours, it gets terminated. Only the absolute best survive. For OBS instability, we have the Cerberus Protocol. Our Watchdog gets a self-healing function that will try to restart and verify the stream if it fails, and if that doesn't work, it automatically switches to the old polling method and alerts the Nexus. And to solve complexity, we have the Unbreakable Contract. All communication between our different services will use strict interfaces defined in Common. It makes the whole system clean, testable, and impossible to break by accident.

In phase four, we unleash true autonomy. The PROF3T project will get its AutonomousLearningSystem, which watches our models and automatically triggers the Shadow Gauntlet if one is underperforming. At the same time, our H4ND workers get a massive upgrade to listen for commands directly from the new vision brain, making them faster and smarter.

And finally, phase five is the launch. This is the final boss battle, Nexus, and you're the one who pushes the button. We start with a 10 percent canary release and monitor it for 24 hours. If everything looks good, we go to 50 percent for 48 hours. And then, we go full send. We unleash Four-Eyes on the entire system and we watch it dominate the world.

So, what do you say? Are you ready to make history? Are you ready to build the most insane AI vision system the world has ever seen? Then give me the green light. Let's go.
