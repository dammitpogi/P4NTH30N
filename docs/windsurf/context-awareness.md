# WindSurf Context Awareness Guide

## Overview

P4NTH30N uses several WindSurf features for context awareness:

## Fast Context

Fast Context provides instant codebase understanding. Key entry points:
- **AGENTS.md**: Each project has an `AGENTS.md` describing its role and conventions
- **codemap.md**: Auto-generated by Cartography, describes file structure and relationships
- **Interfaces/**: `C0MMON/Interfaces/` contains all cross-project API contracts

## Memories

Memories are auto-generated based on codebase analysis. Key memories include:
- Project architecture (multi-agent: H0UND polling, H4ND automation)
- Build commands and verification steps
- Code style guidelines (no var, K&R braces, file-scoped namespaces)
- MongoDB collection naming conventions

## .codeiumignore

Controls which files are included in AI context:

### Allowed
- Config files (`appsettings*.json`, `*.config`)
- Scripts (`scripts/**`, `*.ps1`)
- Build artifacts (for inspection)

### Protected (excluded)
- Actual secrets (`.env`, `*.key`, `master.key`, `id_rsa`, `*.pem`)

## Rules

Custom behavior rules are in `.windsurf/rules/`:
- `memory-rules.md`: Defines auto-memory topics and context priorities

## Cartography Integration

Codemap files are managed by Cartography:
```bash
# Detect changes
python3 ~/.config/opencode/skills/cartography/scripts/cartographer.py changes --root ./

# Update maps
python3 ~/.config/opencode/skills/cartography/scripts/cartographer.py update --root ./
```

Do not manually edit `codemap.md` files - they are auto-generated.
