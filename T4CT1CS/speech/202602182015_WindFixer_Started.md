WindFixer has begun comprehensive implementation work on two parallel tracks. The first track is ARCH-003-PIVOT which addresses the deployment log analyzer validation pipeline. The second track is RAG Discovery which will inform an upcoming architectural decision. Additionally a new decision RAG-001 has been created to capture the upcoming RAG layer implementation.

The current state of decisions shows one hundred forty five total. One hundred thirty six are completed. Seven are proposed. One is in progress. One is rejected. The in progress decision is ARCH-003-PIVOT which WindFixer is actively implementing.

ARCH-003-PIVOT work spans three parts over an expected five day timeline. Part one is the core implementation consisting of three phases. Phase zero builds the Model Testing Platform including ModelTestHarness for automated LM Studio testing PromptConsistencyTester for measuring variance across multiple runs and TemperatureSweep for finding optimal temperature settings. During this phase WindFixer will also investigate SmolLM two point one seven B with temperature zero and improved prompts targeting the seventy percent accuracy threshold set by Oracle. A decision gate at the end of day two will determine whether to keep the LLM as secondary validation or pivot fully to rule based approaches.

Phase one implements the rule based validator with JsonSchemaValidator using NJsonSchema for structural validation BusinessRulesValidator for cross field logic like threshold ordering and schema definitions for credential configurations. Phase two creates the two stage ValidationPipeline with rule based validation handling eighty five percent of cases in under ten milliseconds and LLM secondary handling only uncertain cases in approximately eight seconds. Safety mechanisms mandated by Oracle include input sanitization error logging to the EV three NT collection a circuit breaker that disables the LLM if failure rates exceed ten percent and a manual override flag.

Part two of the WindFixer work is RAG Discovery consisting of six tasks to inform the upcoming RAG-001 decision. Task one audits existing RAG infrastructure including the embedding bridge and FAISS bridge scripts plus INFRA-010 MongoDB RAG Architecture. Task two analyzes the FAISS vector database implementation to determine what is working versus what remains as placeholder specifications. Task three discovers exact context window limits for all available models using the ModelTestHarness built in part one. Task four benchmarks embedding model quality for similarity search accuracy. Task five identifies specific use cases where RAG adds value such as documentation retrieval error pattern matching and jackpot history analysis. Task six assesses hardware constraints given the CPU only limitation on the AMD Ryzen nine three hundred ninety X with one hundred twenty eight gigabytes of RAM.

Part three is codebase analysis reviewing the existing DeployLogAnalyzer components to understand integration points and refactoring needs. This analysis will document how the current validation pipeline works how LogClassifier handles rule based and LLM hybrid classification and how DecisionTracker manages the two thirds rollback threshold.

A new decision RAG-001 has been created to capture the upcoming RAG Layer Architecture implementation. This decision depends on INFRA-010 for MongoDB RAG infrastructure and WIND-010 for context awareness. The decision will be informed by the six discovery documents WindFixer is creating. Key questions include what embedding model to use whether to proceed with FAISS or select an alternative vector database whether to implement hybrid search combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search whether to use real time or batch embedding processing and how to handle context window constraints. The implementation is estimated at five to seven days across four phases covering the embedding pipeline vector store RAG API and comprehensive testing.

The work is underway. WindFixer has a comprehensive prompt with all necessary file references. The discovery documents will provide the foundation for RAG-001 architectural decisions. The pipeline is moving forward on both immediate implementation and future architecture planning.
