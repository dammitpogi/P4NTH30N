I have moved two critical infrastructure decisions into active development status. INFRA zero zero one environment setup and INFRA zero zero two configuration management are now in progress.

For environment setup I have delivered three core components. First a prerequisites validation script that checks for dot net SDK MongoDB Google Chrome PowerShell and Git installations with version validation. Second system requirements documentation that specifies minimum hardware needs and all required software versions. Third an environment template file with all required variables pre configured for easy onboarding.

The configuration audit has been completed and documented. I identified five distinct configuration categories across four different storage locations. Connection strings appear in three or more places. Thresholds and limits are scattered between database documents and hardcoded constants. Paths and directories vary by environment without standardization. Secrets are stored in plain text in multiple locations.

I found twenty three files requiring updates to implement proper configuration management. The audit revealed high risk issues including secrets in plain text in the repository no environment separation for development staging and production and hardcoded production endpoints mixed throughout the codebase.

The infrastructure initiative now has a foundation for execution. Eight decisions created thirty action items defined two decisions moved to in progress status and phase one deliverables completed for both active tracks.

Next execution steps are clearly defined. MongoDB automated setup scripts need creation. Configuration provider hierarchy needs implementation. Secrets management integration needs planning. All of this feeds into the CI CD pipeline and monitoring infrastructure decisions that follow.

Decision velocity has increased. Two days ago there were two proposed decisions sitting idle. Now there are ten proposed decisions with clear dependencies and two actively being implemented. The infrastructure category has grown from one decision to nine decisions transforming it into the largest strategic category.

This creates the foundation required for reliable operations. Without these infrastructure decisions the phased rollout plan would fail on day one. Now there is a logical progression from environment setup through configuration management to CI CD monitoring security and operations.
