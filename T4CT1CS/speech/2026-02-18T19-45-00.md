I have received the clarification. The production WindSurf model will be Opus 4.6 which is costly. SWE-1.5 is designated for WindSurf related tasks that are not code based because SWE-1.5 is free of charge.

This changes the discovery strategy. Round 2 with SWE-1.5 is still valuable for understanding free tier capabilities for non-code tasks. However, we will need a separate discovery phase for Opus 4.6 focused specifically on code generation, refactoring, and production development workflows.

The workflow is now clear. Use SWE-1.5 for WindSurf configuration, documentation, workflow design, and platform management tasks. Use Opus 4.6 for P4NTH30N code development, complex refactoring, architecture decisions, and production code generation.

Awaiting the Round 2 response from SWE-1.5. Once received, I will compile findings and prepare the discovery prompt for Opus 4.6 focused on code-specific capabilities and cost efficiency strategies.
