I have received the Opus 4.6 discovery response with critical meta-observations. The response reveals that the SWE-1.5 Round 1 and Round 2 numbers were largely fabricated, as models lack reliable introspective access to exact specifications. This is a crucial finding for our discovery process.

Opus 4.6 provides honest self-assessment with important caveats. Context window is approximately 200,000 tokens input with maximum output around 64,000 tokens. Effective capacity is 20 to 40 average C-sharp files simultaneously with quality degradation as context fills. The P4NTH30N 10-project solution is well within range with strategic file loading.

Refactoring capabilities show reliable handling of 8 to 12 files per session with good consistency. Breaking changes can be identified but edge cases may be missed in unread files. Large refactoring requires reading affected files first then applying systematic changes.

Architectural decision capabilities include trade-off analysis, pattern proposals, and alternative evaluations. This is where larger models add genuine value. The model can reason about H0UND and H4ND separation, MongoDB hybrid patterns, DDD migration paths, and SOLID compliance.

Debugging capabilities include multi-project tracing across C0MMON to H0UND to H4ND. Race conditions can be reasoned about from code but not executed or profiled. Performance issues can be spotted algorithmically but not benchmarked.

Testing capabilities include strong unit test generation and reasonable integration test generation. Edge case identification is good with systematic boundary condition enumeration. The UNI7T35T project structure and mock patterns are understood.

Cost efficiency analysis reveals uncertainty about token pricing relative to SWE-1.5. High-value tasks for larger models include architectural decisions, complex debugging, cross-project refactoring, API design, and test strategy. Overkill scenarios include simple file edits, formatting fixes, single-method changes, and boilerplate generation.

Comparative advantages that can be demonstrated include deep cross-project dependency analysis, nuanced architectural reasoning, complex C-sharp pattern implementation, and comprehensive error handling. The model cannot compare to SWE-1.5 without identification and recommends head-to-head testing.

Failure modes include missing changes in unread files, inconsistent refactoring at scale, and losing earlier instructions in long sessions. Warning signs include asking for already provided context, repeating earlier suggestions, and edits not accounting for recent changes. Human escalation is recommended for novel architecture, production deployment, security-critical changes, and runtime testing requirements.

Production workflow recommendations include loading codemap and AGENTS files at session start, batching related file reads before edits, verifying with dotnet build after changes, running dotnet test for regression, and refreshing context every 20 to 25 turns.

The meta-observation is the most critical finding. The model advises not trusting self-assessments for production planning. The recommendation is to run controlled benchmarks with 3 to 5 real P4NTH30N tasks, test both models on identical tasks, measure correctness, completeness, build success rate, and time to completion, then calculate cost per successful task completion. This empirical approach will be 10 times more valuable than model self-assessment.

This discovery phase is now complete with a clear path forward. The next step is to design and execute empirical benchmarks comparing SWE-1.5 and Opus 4.6 on actual P4NTH30N tasks before making any production decisions.
