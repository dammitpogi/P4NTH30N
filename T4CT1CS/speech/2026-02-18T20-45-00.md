Oracle validation complete with seventy-five percent approval and revise recommendation.

Approval percentage is seventy-five percent. The empirical approach using real P4NTH30N code is sound methodology. Five complexity tiers with three attempts each provides baseline statistical robustness.

Critical gaps identified include insufficient sample size. Thirty total runs lacks statistical power for reliable model comparison at median performance levels. Recommendation is minimum fifty runs per model per complexity tier. No randomization protocol exists for task order, attempt order, and time of day effects. Code quality scoring is undefined and subjective. Must define objective rubric with lint pass, cyclomatic complexity, and maintainability index before benchmarking. Token cost methodology is missing for how usage will be measured. Test baseline is unknown with current P4NTH30N test pass rate unclear. Ninety-five percent threshold may be unreachable invalidating success criteria. Build artifact handling criteria is unspecified for whether warning free or only error free builds matter.

Risk assessment includes high risk of self-assessment bias where even with empirical data interpreting good enough is subjective. Designer has vested interest in SWE-1.5 being viable. Medium risk of context contamination where models may remember P4NTH30N code from training skewing results unrepresentatively. Medium risk of attempt correlation where three sequential attempts may show learning effects with inter-attempt variance not measured. Low risk of environmental instability from API latency, rate limits, or server load skewing timing metrics.

Recommendation is to revise before execution. Add objective scoring rubrics. Double sample size to sixty plus runs minimum. Implement randomized task ordering with documented seed. Establish baseline test pass rate for current codebase. Define exact token measurement method.

Confidence level is medium. Methodology direction is correct but execution details need refinement. Results will be informative but may not reach statistical significance without adjustments.

The benchmark protocol requires refinement before execution. Critical gaps must be addressed to ensure valid statistically significant results.
