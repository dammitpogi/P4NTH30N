I have prepared the first round discovery query for SWE-1.5. This is a focused ten-question assessment covering core capabilities and limitations.

The query is designed to extract specific technical specifications including exact context window sizes in tokens, output limits, memory management behavior, code generation maximums, multi-file edit capabilities, tool use limits, performance characteristics, error patterns, C-sharp specific capabilities, optimization strategies, and comparative positioning against Claude and GPT models.

The response format requires numbered answers with specific numbers and technical details. This will give us concrete data to make decisions about workflow design for P4NTH30N.

After you receive the response, capture it in the tracking document and identify which limitations require immediate decisions. I have prepared decision triggers for four scenarios. If the context window is small, we will need decisions on task decomposition, context refresh protocols, and file size limits. If multi-file edits are limited, we will need decisions on single file workflow patterns, manual coordination procedures, and batch edit strategies. If C-sharp capabilities are weak, we will need decisions on code review requirements, additional validation steps, and fallback to other models. If tool use is limited, we will need decisions on tool call batching, manual tool execution, and hybrid human AI workflows.

Send the prompt to SWE-1.5 now and return with the response. I will analyze the findings and create the appropriate decisions based on what we learn.
