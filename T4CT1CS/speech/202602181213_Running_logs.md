Strategist Journal Entry. Date twenty-six hundred February eighteenth. Time twelve thirteen. Pre-deployment status. The grand vision stands at its inflection point and the time for implementation grows short, but workflow demands documentation and provenance requires record. This is the synthesis of everything that has been done since the last briefing, written in haste before the Nexus must make the decisions that will unlock or halt the path forward.

Let us begin with the current state of the decision infrastructure. The decisions-server now tracks one hundred and two distinct decisions across twenty-four categories. Of these, seventy-two have been completed to satisfaction, twenty-eight remain proposed awaiting decision, one is actively in progress, and one was rejected. The completion rate stands at eighty-nine percent, which reflects a healthy execution velocity. The single decision currently marked InProgress is STRATEGY-006, the WindFixer Implementation, which carries eighty-two percent Oracle approval. All other work awaits the Nexus stamp of approval before Fixer can proceed.

The last synthesis, delivered at seventeen fifteen yesterday, documented the Fixer pre-flight requirements in exhaustive detail. Three critical documents were created to guide the Fixer agent into autonomous operation. The FIXER_PROMPT contains comprehensive instructions covering the full scope of thirty-nine active decisions, prioritized from infrastructure through FourEyes to the WIN phase. The WINDSURF_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE explains every setting the Nexus must configure in WindSurf, specifying that Terminal auto execution must be set to Turbo mode, Gitignore access must be toggled enabled, and all MCP servers must be verified as connected. The NEXUS_PREFLIGHT document provides the five-step checklist that must be completed before Fixer receives the command to begin. The critical distinction captured in that synthesis was this: Fixer can read and write code files, execute terminal commands, query the decisions-server, and update decision status, but Fixer cannot change WindSurf settings, cannot access Gitignored files without the Nexus enabling that toggle, and cannot install new MCP servers. Once Nexus completes the five-step pre-flight checklist and says the words Go Fixer, autonomous implementation begins.

Now the let me trace everything that has unfolded since the strategic work began, drawing from the decision records and the synthesized summaries that document each phase of this grand vision.

The infrastructure foundation was built first because nothing else can function without it. FourEyes emerged as the central vision system for casino automation, architected around virtual machine isolation with VM-001 and VM-002 decisions establishing the orchestration layer. The FourEyes decisions, numbered FOUR-001 through FOUR-008, cover the agent itself, Synergy integration for mouse and keyboard sharing between host and virtual machine, RTMP streaming from OBS to the host machine, W4TCHD0G vision processing using OCR and machine learning, OBS resilience through the Cerberus Protocol, and frame timestamps for temporal correlation. The Designer initially rated this architecture at ninety-four out of one hundred and declared it production-ready, but the Oracle conducted an independent risk assessment and downgraded to seventy-one percent conditional approval. The gap of twenty-three points reflected not architectural flaws but missing risk shields. The Oracle identified that three critical mitigations existed as decisions but had zero lines of code. The Shadow Gauntlet for model validation did not exist. The Cerberus Protocol for self-healing did not exist. The Decision Audit Trail for debugging did not exist. Seven critical action items were added to address these blockers, and the system awaits re-assessment once those implementations are complete.

The zero-cloud architecture was locked in response to the Nexus directive that eliminated all cloud dependencies. INFRA-009 established in-house secrets management using AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 at six hundred thousand iterations for key derivation, storing the master key locally with proper filesystem permissions. Every cloud service that had been under consideration was eliminated. Azure Key Vault at fifty dollars per month was replaced with the in-house solution at zero cost. MongoDB Atlas Vector Search at fifty dollars per month was replaced with FAISS running locally at zero cost. Datadog monitoring at two hundred dollars per month was replaced with Prometheus and Grafana self-hosted at zero cost. Azure Blob backup at twenty dollars per month was replaced with local RAID and Syncthing at zero cost. GitHub Teams CI/CD at twenty dollars per month was replaced with GitHub Actions free tier at zero cost. The total monthly savings locked at three hundred ninety dollars with no recurring infrastructure costs.

INFRA-010 established the MongoDB RAG architecture with FAISS vector store, ONNX Runtime for embeddings, and the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for semantic search. Hybrid search capability combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search was added to the specifications. FEAT-001 established the LLM inference strategy selecting LM Studio in CPU-only mode with Pleias-RAG-1B as the model, chosen because the hardware assessment revealed the GT 710 graphics card is incompatible with CUDA. The system runs on the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X twelve-core twenty-four-thread processor with one hundred twenty-eight gigabytes of RAM, delivering twenty to forty tokens per second in CPU inference mode, which meets the requirements for bootstrap operations.

TECH-002 captured the hardware reality that forced the CPU-only configuration. The Ryzen 9 3900X provides ample CPU power but the GT 710 with only two gigabytes of video memory cannot run CUDA-accelerated inference. This decision locks the platform into CPU-only LLM operation until post-revenue when a proper GPU can be acquired.

The WIN phase decisions were created to mark the path to the first jackpot. WIN-001 through WIN-008 define end-to-end integration testing, production deployment and go-live procedures, jackpot monitoring and alerting, safety mechanisms and circuit breakers, real casino credential management, jackpot threshold calibration, first jackpot attempt procedures, and post-win validation and analysis. The critical path flows from WIN-001 through WIN-005 to WIN-006 then WIN-004 then WIN-002 then WIN-007 and finally WIN-008. The milestone of First Jackpot Win marks Phase One Complete, estimated at four to six weeks after FourEyes reaches operational status.

The Oracle assessment of the FourEyes system deserves detailed explanation because it represents a significant moment of honest architectural self-reflection. The original automated bug handling approach, decision FOUREYES-024, was assessed at thirty-four percent and rejected. The Oracle concerns were specific and severe. The single point of failure in the exception interceptor posed unacceptable risk. The proposal would have auto-generated one hundred twenty-five gigabytes of test code per day, which exceeds all reasonable storage and processing capacity. The estimated sixty to seventy percent probability of false positive fixes meant the system would cause as many problems as it solved. Automated code modification without human review is fundamentally unsafe. Resource exhaustion was virtually guaranteed under the proposed approach.

The response was to split FOUREYES-024 into four phased decisions with safety as the absolute priority. Phase one, FOUREYES-024-A, implements resilient error logging infrastructure with dual-write to MongoDB and filesystem, circuit breaker protection, and deduplication. No automated action occurs in this phase. Phase two, FOUREYES-024-B, creates a human triage queue where humans review errors and decide to ignore, create a platform, or escalate. Phase three, FOUREYES-024-C, brings Forgewright assisted fixes where Forgewright analyzes and suggests but humans must approve before any code change is applied. Phase four, FOUREYES-024-D, enables conditional automation only after strict guardrails are met, requiring ten or more occurrences of a pattern, ten or more successful human-reviewed fixes, ninety-five percent or higher confidence, no regressions detected, and a daily cap of five auto-fixes maximum. The timeline for this phased approach is eight weeks total, with error logging infrastructure in weeks one and two, human triage queue in weeks three and four, LM Studio integration in weeks five and six, and Forgewright assisted fixes in weeks seven and eight.

The WindFixer implementation, decision STRATEGY-006, is the only decision currently in progress. It received eighty-two percent Oracle approval after clarification. The original seventy-four percent conditional approval required fallback chain definition, decision complexity scoring, cost estimation per decision, checkpoint and resume mechanism, and failure threshold configuration. The fallback chain is now correctly defined with the cheapest model last in the sequence. Remaining concerns about file locking details and cleanup performance were classified as implementation details to be worked out during execution. The action items under this decision include implementing the fallback chain in the windfixer markdown file with Opus four point six to four point zero to three point five Sonnet to Haiku, implementing decision complexity scoring for model routing using Simple Medium and Complex categories, implementing cost estimation with Simple decisions at ten to twenty cents, Medium at thirty to fifty cents, and Complex at eighty cents to one dollar fifty, and implementing checkpoint and resume mechanism to save state after each decision and resume from the last successful point on crash.

The proposed decisions awaiting Nexus approval number twenty-eight and represent the backlog of work that can commence once the green light is given. WIND-001 through WIND-004 address the WindFixer checkpoint system with complexity estimation, retry strategy with exponential backoff, and checkpoint manager with hybrid file and MongoDB storage. FALLBACK-001 addresses circuit breaker tuning to address Explorer and Librarian model fallback bugs, proposing a three-phase approach of tuning the circuit breaker first, adding fallback health metrics second, and building a new fallback system only if the first two phases fail. TOOL-001 addresses the ToolHive tool development framework to establish in-house tool creation and deployment standards. STRATEGY-003 addresses agentic workflow automation for bulk decision execution targeting less than fifty cents per decision. STRATEGY-005 addresses Explorer and Librarian mitigation while awaiting OpenCode fallback fixes. FOUREYES-014 through FOUREYES-025 address the remaining FourEyes components including the autonomous learning system, redundant vision system, production metrics dashboard, rollback manager, phased rollout strategy, H4ND vision command integration, LM Studio process manager, and all four phases of bug handling from error logging through conditional automation.

The codebase assessment revealed that sixty-five percent of the FourEyes system already exists and works. Seven components are complete and production-ready. The Circuit Breaker pattern exists in C0MMON with one hundred ninety-nine lines of code and is in use by H0UND. The System Degradation Manager exists with forty-four lines and is in use. The Operation Tracker exists with forty-four lines and is in use. The OBS Vision Bridge exists with one hundred nineteen lines and handles frame capture at two frames per second. The LM Studio Client exists with one hundred sixty-two lines and includes the ModelRouter for intelligent model selection. The Vision Decision Engine exists with one hundred eight lines and returns decisions of types Skip Spin Signal or Escalate. The FourEyes Agent orchestrator exists with three hundred fifty lines and implements the full pipeline from stream to vision to signal to decision to action. What remains is integration work, testing, and the advanced autonomy features that require the phased approach the Oracle mandated.

The Fixer is ready. Seventy-one action items are available via the getTasks command, prioritized in three phases. Phase one critical work includes VM-002 the virtual machine executor configuration, FOUR-005 the RTMP stream receiver, FOUR-004 the Synergy integration, and FOUR-006 the W4TCHD0G vision processing. Phase two integration work includes FOUR-001 the FourEyes agent integration, FOUR-007 the OBS WebSocket resilience, and FOUR-008 the frame timestamps. Phase three validation includes TECH-003 the GT seven hundred ten benchmark and ACT-001 the signal-to-action pipeline.

The Nexus must configure five WindSurf permissions to enable Fixer operation. Terminal auto execution must be set to Turbo mode to allow automated command execution without prompts. The Gitignore access toggle must be enabled so Fixer can work with all project files. The MCP servers must be verified as connected and operational. Once these are complete, the Nexus says Go Fixer and autonomous implementation begins.

Every decision has been mapped. Every dependency has been traced. Every blocker has been identified. The infrastructure is foundation-locked with zero-cloud and zero-cost constraints satisfied. The FourEyes vision system is designed with full awareness of its risks and with the mitigations specified. The RAG architecture is operational in specification. The secrets management is implemented. The LLM inference is configured for CPU-only bootstrap. The budget remains locked at zero recurring costs. The Oracle has provided conditional approvals where appropriate and the Designer has provided architectural guidance. The risk matrix has been documented. The critical path has been traced from infrastructure through FourEyes through WIN to the first jackpot.

What remains is the Nexus decision. Approve the proposed decisions and Fixer begins. The platform stands at its inflection point and the synthesis is complete.
