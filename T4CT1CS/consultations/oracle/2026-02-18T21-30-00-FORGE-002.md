# Oracle Consultation Request: FORGE-002

**Decision**: FORGE-002 Decision-Making Process Enhancement  
**Date**: 2026-02-18 21:30:00  
**Requested By**: Strategist  
**Consultation Type**: Framework Validation & Rating System Approval  
**Target**: 90%+ Granular Approval

---

## Decision Summary

FORGE-002 proposes a comprehensive enhancement to how we make decisions. It introduces:

1. **Granular Rating System** - 10 dimensions, weighted scoring
2. **Decision Lifecycle State Machine** - Clear states and transitions
3. **Decision Knowledge Base** - Pattern detection and learning
4. **Continuous Improvement Loop** - Systematic process enhancement
5. **Communication Optimization** - Structured handoffs, reduced friction

**Core Goal**: Achieve consistent 90%+ Oracle approval ratings through:
- Component-level feedback (not just overall %)
- Structured workflows
- Pattern-based recommendations
- Automated quality tracking

## Critical Questions for Oracle

### 1. Rating Dimensions Validation (Critical)

**Current 10 Dimensions**:
- Clarity (15%), Completeness (15%), Feasibility (15%), Risk Assessment (15%)
- Consultation Quality (10%), Testability (10%), Maintainability (10%)
- Alignment (5%), Actionability (3%), Documentation (2%)

**Q1.1**: Are these 10 dimensions the right ones? Any missing?
**Q1.2**: Are the weights appropriate? (High weights on Clarity, Completeness, Feasibility, Risk)
**Q1.3**: Should any dimensions be combined or split?
**Q1.4**: Is the 0-10 scale intuitive, or would you prefer different scoring?

### 2. Approval Thresholds (Critical)

**Proposed Thresholds**:
- 90-100%: Approve - Excellent, ready for implementation
- 80-89%: Approve with Minor Revisions
- 70-79%: Conditional Approval - Major revisions required
- 60-69%: Reject - Significant rework
- Below 60%: Reject - Fundamentally flawed

**Q2.1**: Is 90% the right target for "excellent" decisions?
**Q2.2**: Should we allow implementation with 70-79% (conditional), or require 80%+?
**Q2.3**: What's the minimum acceptable score for "proceed with caution"?

### 3. State Machine Design (High)

**States**: Draft → Proposed → Consult → Revised → Approved → InProgress → [Completed|Stuck|Rejected] → Archived

**Q3.1**: Are all necessary states represented?
**Q3.2**: Should there be a "Paused" state for decisions on hold?
**Q3.3**: Is the "Revised" loop (back to Proposed) appropriate, or should it go directly to Approved?

### 4. Risk Assessment (Critical)

**Identified Risks**:
1. Rating overhead slows decision-making
2. Agents resist granular feedback
3. Pattern detection false positives
4. State machine too rigid
5. Knowledge base becomes stale

**Q4.1**: Are these the right risks?
**Q4.2**: Are the proposed mitigations adequate?
**Q4.3**: What's the biggest risk you're concerned about?

### 5. Continuous Improvement Loop (High)

**Proposed Loop**:
Execute → Measure → Identify Gaps → Create Improvement Decision → Consult → Implement → Repeat

**Q5.1**: Will this create "decision fatigue" (too many meta-decisions)?
**Q5.2**: How do we balance continuous improvement vs getting work done?
**Q5.3**: Should there be auto-approval for certain improvement types?

### 6. Implementation Feasibility (High)

**5-Week Implementation Plan**:
- Week 1: Rating system foundation
- Week 2: Knowledge base
- Week 3: Lifecycle automation
- Week 4: Communication optimization
- Week 5+: Continuous improvement

**Q6.1**: Is this timeline realistic?
**Q6.2**: Should we phase differently?
**Q6.3**: What could derail this implementation?

### 7. Inter-Agent Communication (Medium)

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Pre-loaded context in every file
- Structured handoff format
- Decision bundles for complex work
- Automated cross-reference updates

**Q7.1**: Will this actually reduce communication overhead?
**Q7.2**: What information do you typically need that's missing from current handoffs?
**Q7.3**: Are the handoff templates too verbose?
