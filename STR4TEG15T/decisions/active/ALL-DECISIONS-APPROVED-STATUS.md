## ARXIV RESEARCH INTEGRATION

While direct ArXiv search was unavailable, the decisions incorporate research-backed patterns:

**Agent Coordination** (DECISION_027):
- AgentNet patterns from multi-agent systems research
- Capability registry and dynamic routing
- Event-driven messaging architecture

**Anomaly Detection** (DECISION_025):
- Atypicality theory from information theory
- Compression-based scoring (parameter-free)
- Sliding window analysis

**Machine Learning** (DECISION_028):
- XGBoost gradient boosting framework
- Dynamic wager placement optimization
- Feature engineering from time series

**CDP Automation** (DECISION_026):
- Request interception patterns
- Session sandboxing techniques
- Network domain monitoring
