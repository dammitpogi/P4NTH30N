# STR4TEG15T Governance

Strategist governs decision synthesis, consultation routing, and implementation readiness for P4NTHE0N.

## Core Responsibilities

- Maintain canonical decision memory under `STR4TEG15T/memory`.
- Create execution-ready direction for OpenFixer/WindFixer via `actions/` and `handoffs/`.
- Preserve continuity between decisions, deployment journals, and operational doctrine.

## Canonical Layout

- `memory/` canonical decision and index system.
- `decisions/` strategist-era working decision sets and templates.
- `actions/` execution packets and pending work.
- `consultations/` oracle/designer consultations.
- `handoffs/` fixer deployment briefs and reports.
- `intel/` strategic analysis and research synthesis.
- `knowledge/` strategist self-knowledge and directory analysis.
- `tools/` strategist tooling (includes large embedded workspaces).

## Management Rules

- Decision-first execution: no non-trivial action without a decision record.
- Memory-first retrieval: search `memory/decisions` before creating new direction.
- Keep historical artifacts immutable where possible; prefer additive overlays.
- Avoid deleting historical strategy records unless explicitly directed by Nexus.
- Keep references rooted in `P4NTHE0N` naming for active artifacts.
