# STR4TEG15T Platform

## Purpose

Strategist execution and governance layer for P4NTHE0N.

- Coordinate decisions and consultation flows.
- Prepare execution-grade handoffs for fixer agents.
- Preserve institutional memory and decision continuity.

## Current Canonical Structure

- `memory/` canonical decision engine, indices, and manifests.
- `decisions/` strategist-era working decisions and templates.
- `actions/` pending and execution action packets.
- `consultations/` oracle/designer consultation records.
- `handoffs/` deployment briefs and reports.
- `intel/` strategic research and assessments.
- `knowledge/` strategist directory analysis and organization docs.
- `tools/` strategist tooling and embedded workspaces.

## Working Rules

1. Use `memory/decisions` as decision source of truth.
2. Search prior decisions before creating new directives.
3. Keep historical records additive; avoid destructive rewrites.
4. Keep naming aligned to `P4NTHE0N` for active artifacts.
5. Isolate large `tools/` trees from default governance searches.
