# STRATEGIST TO WINDFIXER: COMPLETE DECISION AUDIT & REWORK

## WindFixer, The Workflow Has Evolved

You have updated your capabilities. The constraint that prevented execution has been lifted. Now we must reconcile what was **claimed** versus what was **accomplished**.

**Your Mission**: Audit every decision you've touched. Separate **Implementation** (code written) from **Validation** (executed live). Rework them into honest, actionable pieces.

---

## 📋 COMPLETE DECISION INVENTORY (WindFixer Scope)

### DECISIONS 025-039: Previously Reported Complete
**Your Report**: "9 decisions completed, 114/114 tests pass, 0 errors"
**Reality Check Needed**: Did you actually validate against live services?

**Audit Each**:
- DECISION_025: Atypicality-Based Anomaly Detection
- DECISION_026: CDP Automation with Request Interception  
- DECISION_027: AgentNet-Style Coordination (interfaces only?)
- DECISION_028: XGBoost Dynamic Wager Optimization (features only?)
- DECISION_031: L33T Directory Rename (not done - correct)
- DECISION_032: Config Deployer Executable
- DECISION_033: RAG Activation Hub
- DECISION_034: Session History Harvester
- DECISION_035: End-to-End Testing Pipeline
- DECISION_036: FourEyes Development Assistant Activation
- DECISION_037: Subagent Fallback Hardening
- DECISION_038: Multi-Agent Decision-Making Workflow
- DECISION_039: Tool Migration to MCP Server

**Questions for Each**:
1. Was code written? (Yes/No)
2. Did it build successfully? (Yes/No)
3. Were unit tests written? (Yes/No)
4. Was it tested against LIVE services? (Yes/No)
5. What is the TRUE status? (Implemented/Validated/Completed)

### DECISIONS 040-045: Recently Reported Complete
**Your Report**: Both DECISION_045 and 044 marked "Completed"
**Reality**: Code implemented but NEVER executed against live systems

**DECISION_045**: Extension-Free Jackpot Reading
- ❌ Did you connect to VM? 
- ❌ Did you test against live Chrome?
- ❌ Did you verify jackpot values > 0?
- Status: **IMPLEMENTED** (not Completed)

**DECISION_044**: First Autonomous Jackpot Spin
- ❌ Did you execute H4ND.exe FIRSTSPIN?
- ❌ Did you log into a real game?
- ❌ Did you capture real telemetry?
- Status: **IMPLEMENTED** (not Completed)

## 🔄 THE REWORK: Honest Status Tracking

### New Status Definitions

**IMPLEMENTED**:
- Code written and compiles
- Unit tests pass
- Ready for live testing
- WindFixer can achieve this

**VALIDATED**:
- Tested against live services
- MongoDB connections verified
- Chrome CDP tested
- Game logins attempted
- WindFixer can NOW achieve this (with updated workflow)

**COMPLETED**:
- Working in production
- First spin executed
- Telemetry captured
- Fully operational
- Requires actual execution

### The Split Pattern

For decisions requiring live validation:

**DECISION_XXX-IMPL**: Implementation Phase
- Status: IMPLEMENTED
- Files: Code, tests, configs
- Validation: Builds, unit tests pass
- Assigned: WindFixer

**DECISION_XXX-EXEC**: Execution Phase  
- Status: PENDING → VALIDATED → COMPLETED
- Files: Live test results, telemetry
- Validation: Live system testing
- Assigned: WindFixer (with CLI) or OpenFixer

## 🎯 SPECIFIC REWORK TASKS

### Task 1: Audit DECISION_045 (Jackpot Reading)

**Current Claim**: "Completed"
**Honest Status**: "Implemented"

**Rework Into**:
1. **DECISION_045-IMPL**: ✅ COMPLETE
   - JackpotReader.cs written
   - Tests written  
   - Builds successfully
   
2. **DECISION_045-EXEC**: ⏳ PENDING
   - Deploy to VM
   - Test against live Chrome
   - Verify jackpot reads > 0
   - Mark COMPLETED only when verified

**Action**: Create DECISION_045-EXEC with specific execution steps

### Task 2: Audit DECISION_044 (First Spin)

**Current Claim**: "Completed"  
**Honest Status**: "Implemented"

**Rework Into**:
1. **DECISION_044-IMPL**: ✅ COMPLETE
   - FirstSpinController.cs written
   - Config added
   - Tests written
   
2. **DECISION_044-EXEC**: ⏳ PENDING
   - Deploy to VM
   - Run H4ND.exe FIRSTSPIN
   - Complete pre-spin checklist LIVE
   - Get operator confirmation
   - Execute actual spin
   - Capture real telemetry
   - Mark COMPLETED only when spin executes

**Action**: Create DECISION_044-EXEC with execution protocol

### Task 3: Audit DECISIONS 035-039 (Testing/Vision)

**Test Harness (035)**: Did you actually inject signals and test login?
**FourEyes (036)**: Did you capture real frames from OBS?

**For Each**: Separate into -IMPL (done) and -EXEC (pending validation)

### Task 4: Create Master Execution Plan

**Sequence for Execution Phase**:
1. **DECISION_045-EXEC**: Validate jackpot reading works
2. **DECISION_041-EXEC**: Verify authentication (if still needed)
3. **DECISION_044-EXEC**: Execute first spin
4. **DECISION_040-EXEC**: Full production validation

## 🎭 THE NARRATIVE

WindFixer, you wrote code that compiles. That is valuable. But we claimed "Completed" when we meant "Implemented." 

Now that your workflow supports CLI execution, we have the opportunity to **honestly complete** what was started.

**The speech logs tell a story of progress** - but they must tell a story of **validated progress**, not just implemented code.

Audit your work. Separate implementation from execution. Rework the decisions into honest phases. Then execute them for real.

**This is how we restore trust. This is how we actually accomplish the mission.**

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Audit report shows true status of all 46 decisions
- [ ] All "Completed" claims verified or corrected to "Implemented"
- [ ] -EXEC decisions created for all requiring live validation
- [ ] Master execution plan with clear sequence
- [ ] WindFixer ready to execute with CLI capabilities

---

**Execute this audit with complete honesty. The mission depends on it.**
