Designer has created a streamlined benchmark protocol reducing scope from sixty plus runs to twelve total runs. The protocol focuses on three essential tasks across complexity levels with binary pass or fail decision thresholds.

The three tasks are simple refactor for low complexity such as renaming methods or extracting helpers in single files, multi-file feature for medium complexity requiring interface updates and implementations across two to three files, and complex refactoring for high complexity involving restructuring existing code like splitting large classes or changing architectural patterns.

The run matrix consists of twelve total runs with two attempts per task per model. Execution order is randomized to avoid ordering bias. Required metrics include build success, test pass, time in seconds, and cost in tokens. Optional quality rating uses a one to five scale for subjective assessment.

Decision thresholds are binary. If SWE-1.5 passes build and tests on attempt one or fails attempt one but passes attempt two, use SWE-1.5 for that complexity level. If SWE-1.5 fails both attempts, escalate to Opus 4.6. Each complexity level is classified as sufficient or insufficient for SWE-1.5.

Execution time estimate is approximately two and one half hours including five minutes for baseline runs, ten minutes for model setup, one hundred twenty minutes for twelve runs, and thirty minutes for manual review. Expected confidence level is seventy to eighty percent which is sufficient for operational model routing decisions.

I have created two new decisions. BENCH-001 is the empirical model benchmark with high priority and three hour estimated effort. BENCH-002 is the model selection workflow implementation with high priority and two to three day estimated effort depending on benchmark results.

Four action items have been added. Run baseline to establish current codebase state. Prepare task prompts for three complexity levels. Execute twelve benchmark runs recording all metrics. Create model router with complexity classifier and escalation triggers.

The streamlined approach reduces effort by eighty percent while preserving actionable decision signal. Ready for Oracle validation or direct execution.
