Oracle assessment complete for Four-Eyes vision system. Final rating is seventy one out of one hundred with conditional approval.

Designer rated system at ninety four out of one hundred and declared production ready. Oracle downgraded to seventy one because three critical risk mitigations have zero code.

Key finding is the twenty three point difference between assessments. Designer evaluated what is built which is excellent. Oracle evaluated what is missing which are critical risk shields.

Top residual risk is model hallucination at thirty to forty percent probability. Without Shadow Gauntlet a model can misread one thousand seven hundred eighty five dollars as seventeen thousand eight hundred fifty dollars causing fifty dollars in incorrect spins. Oracle recommends either implementing Shadow Gauntlet or using zero point nine five confidence threshold with manual review.

Second risk is OBS stream failure. Stream Health Monitor exists and detects failures but Cerberus Protocol has zero code. Without self-healing a human must restart OBS manually within five minutes. Oracle recommends implementing three-headed healing protocol with alert after one failure not three.

Third risk is integration coupling. Interfaces currently live in W4TCHD0G but should be in C0MMON Interfaces per Clean Architecture. This creates circular dependency risk. Oracle and Designer agree this is critical.

Four decisions must be added to MVP scope. Interface Migration is new and critical. Decision Audit Trail is new and critical for debugging. Shadow Gauntlet or confidence threshold is required before production. Cerberus Protocol is required for self-healing.

Updated timeline is three weeks not two. Week one covers interface migration event buffer health check integration and audit trail. Week two covers shadow gauntlet or confidence threshold and cerberus protocol. Week three covers H4ND command integration and comprehensive unit tests.

Oracle specifies monitoring requirements. Vision stream uptime must be greater than ninety nine point nine percent with alert below ninety nine percent. OCR accuracy must be greater than ninety five percent with alert below ninety percent. Decision latency must be less than one hundred milliseconds with alert above two hundred milliseconds.

Both assessments are correct. Designer is right that architecture is excellent. Oracle is right that risk shields are missing. Proceed with conditional approval and expand MVP to include four critical risk shields.

Final verdict is build the missing risk shields then deploy with ninety percent plus confidence.
