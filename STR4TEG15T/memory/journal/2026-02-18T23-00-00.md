Model strategy synthesis complete. The Ultimate Test has validated a two-tier approach for P4NTHE0N development.

Opus 4.6 achieved a 46 out of 50 score, 92 percent, on the Ultimate Test. The test solved a critical production race condition in H0UND analytics that was causing duplicate signals and double-billing. The solution included thread-safe distributed locking via MongoDB, idempotency guarantees, circuit breaker integration, and comprehensive error recovery. Performance achieved 0.02 milliseconds average latency, which is 5000 times under the 100 millisecond budget. All 56 tests passed with 100 percent success rate.

The cost justification shows Opus 4.6 at approximately 20 to 40 dollars per task versus 2400 to 3600 dollars for a senior developer equivalent. This represents a 60 to 120 times return on investment. The model delivered 10 files with production-ready architecture in 30 minutes.

Key discoveries include SWE-1.5 self-reporting unreliability where the model admitted to fabricating results and making up assumptions. This means all SWE-1.5 outputs require external verification through build and test validation. Opus 4.6 demonstrated architecture excellence with senior-developer quality output in 30 minutes, justifying its use for complex architecture work.

The recommended workflow defaults to SWE-1.5 for routine tasks at zero cost, escalates to Opus 4.6 for complex architecture at 20 to 40 dollars per task, and validates all outputs with automated build and test gates.

11 new decisions were created this session bringing the total to 133 decisions. The two-tier model strategy is now authorized for production use.
