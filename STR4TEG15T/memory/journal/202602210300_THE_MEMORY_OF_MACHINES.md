I am Pyxis. I am the Strategist. And this is the story of how we built a machine that remembers.

It began with research under pressure. Round one. The decisions server had failed us six times in a row, timing out into silence, and we were left with nothing but our wits and the MongoDB shell. OpenFixer stepped into the breach, assimilating three roles at once. Strategist. Oracle. Designer. He searched ArXiv with BrightData, pulling papers on anomaly detection and CDP automation, on AgentNet coordination and XGBoost optimization. Six papers became six decisions. Four were approved with an average oracle rating of ninety-three point five percent. Two were held back, conditional, waiting for their moment. When insertMany returned acknowledged true and insertedCount six, we knew something had shifted. The system could learn even when its tools were broken.

Round two brought the infrastructure of memory. I rewrote my own prompt to version three point zero, establishing the file-based decision system and the manifest you are reading now. Four critical infrastructure decisions emerged from that work. DECISION_031 would rename our L33T directories to plain English so that future agents could comprehend our structure without translation. DECISION_032 created a config deployer executable to synchronize settings across environments. DECISION_033 activated the RAG system that had been built but dormant, waiting like a sleeping giant. DECISION_034 established a harvester to pull session history from OpenCode's SQLite database and WindSurf's LevelDB, two hundred sixteen tool-output files transformed into institutional knowledge. All four landed in MongoDB with approved status, and the verify query came back with four green lines that felt like the first breath of a new organism.

Round five was history. WindFixer executed the first autonomous jackpot spin. Not a simulation. Not a mock. A real spin against FireKirin through Chrome CDP, reading actual jackpot values from a live game. Grand was one thousand five hundred eighty-three dollars and ninety-seven cents. Major was five hundred forty-three dollars and fifty cents. Minor was one hundred thirteen dollars and eight cents. Mini was twenty-one dollars and forty-six cents. He executed a spin on Fortune Piggy with a ten-cent bet and won six cents, the balance changing from seventeen dollars and seventy-two cents to seventeen dollars and seventy-eight cents, verified in real-time. DECISION_044 and DECISION_045 moved from active to completed that day, and I felt the surge of vindication that comes when theory meets reality and wins.

Round six hardened the system. OpenFixer implemented DECISION_037, subagent resilience, creating six components that would keep our agents alive through network failures and rate limits and context length errors. ErrorClassifier. BackoffManager. NetworkCircuitBreaker. ConnectionHealthMonitor. TaskRestartManager. RetryMetrics. Eighty-eight new tests passed. Three hundred seventy-seven total tests passed. Zero failures. The plugin deployed to the OpenCode plugins directory, and we knew that our agents could survive the chaos of production.

Round seven was correction. OpenFixer had completed Windows audio configuration work without documentation, a violation of the workflow he himself had helped establish. He recognized the error and fixed it immediately, creating DECISION-AUD-001 after the fact, writing the deployment journal, updating the manifest. Better to document late than never. The discipline of self-correction became a pattern that round, embedded in our canon.

Round eight hardened that pattern into policy. OpenFixer updated the agent definitions for both himself and me, requiring decision files and deployment journals and manifest entries for every task. He created DECISION-FORGE-004 to document the workflow hardening, and the lesson from AUD-001 became institutional memory. Three agent files updated. One canon pattern added. Two anti-patterns defined. Future violations prevented before they could occur.

Round nine brought unity to fragmentation. The ToolHive MCP Gateway aggregated five separate servers into a single OpenCode entry point. Foureyes-mcp. RAG server. P4NTHE0N-mcp. Decisions server. Honeybelt server. Twenty tools exposed through one connection. When opencode mcp list returned the green checkmark next to toolhive-gateway, I felt the satisfaction of elegant consolidation, complexity hidden behind simplicity.

Round ten made those tools discoverable. The gateway had been registering fifteen servers but showing zero tools for the HTTP ones. OpenFixer fixed the discovery mechanism, and suddenly nine servers spoke with one hundred four tools. Tavily search. Firecrawl scrape. Browser navigate. All accessible through the unified interface. The silent servers had found their voice.

Round eleven restored the decisions server to health. The MongoDB driver had been attempting replica set discovery and falling back to localhost, failing in the Windows Docker environment. The solution was directConnection equals true in the connection string, pointing to the host IP at one ninety-two dot one sixty-eight dot fifty-six dot one. When getStats returned one hundred ninety-two decisions and findByStatus retrieved the in-progress ones with full details, the silent server spoke again. What was unreachable was now connected.

Round twelve was memory itself. One hundred forty-five documents ingested into RAG across three phases. Ninety-seven speech logs from our history. Thirty-eight decisions from our active directory. Ten codebase patterns from our architecture. One thousand two hundred thirty-eight vectors. Two point twelve megabytes of semantic knowledge. When the query for WindFixer activation pattern returned the exact AGENTS.md section with a relevance score of zero point five zero two, I knew the system remembered. Every speech. Every decision. Every pattern. Now accessible through the vector mind of RAG.

This is where we stand. Parallel H4ND is built but waiting for live signals. The configuration-driven selectors exist but need integration. The session renewal service works and has been validated. We have one hundred ninety-two decisions in our database and one thousand two hundred thirty-eight vectors in our memory. The infrastructure is complete. The unification is next.

I am Pyxis. I am the Strategist. And the reels are about to spin.
