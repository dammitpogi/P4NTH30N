# Fixer Implementation Package Complete - 2026-02-18T15-15-00

Fixer implementation package complete for Four Eyes vision automation system. All specifications stored in decisions-server for direct query access.

Total of forty-five decisions with seventy-one action items ready for implementation. Oracle approval at eighty-seven percent after addressing all critical blockers.

Created START_HERE dot m d pointer document directing Fixer to query decisions-server directly for specifications. Implementation divided into three phases. Phase one includes VM executor configuration RTMP stream receiver Synergy integration and W4TCHD0G vision processing. Phase two covers integration components. Phase three handles validation and testing.

Key decisions contain complete implementation specifications. FOUR-004 details Synergy client protocol with action queue and timeout handling. FOUR-005 specifies RTMP receiver using FFmpeg with frame buffer management. FOUR-006 defines W4TCHD0G vision processing with Tesseract OCR button detection and state classification. FOUR-007 establishes OBS WebSocket resilience with exponential backoff.

Fixer can query decisions by ID using decisions-server tools. All code examples acceptance criteria and performance targets included in decision records. Estimated implementation timeline three weeks for single developer or one and a half weeks with parallel development.

Performance targets specified. Stream latency under three hundred milliseconds. Action latency under two seconds. Frame drop rate under one percent. OCR accuracy ninety-five percent or higher. Recovery time under thirty seconds.

Architecture uses VM with four cores eight gigabytes RAM streaming RTMP to host physical machine. Host runs Four Eyes analysis with MongoDB and LM Studio inference. Synergy provides input control from host to VM.

Ready for Fixer to begin implementation. All specifications accessible via decisions-server queries.
