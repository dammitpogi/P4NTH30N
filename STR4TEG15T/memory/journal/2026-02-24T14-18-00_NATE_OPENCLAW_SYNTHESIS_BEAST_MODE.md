Pressure was real and immediate: a friend system was down in production, gateway readiness was false, and every action risked making the blast radius worse. The operating constraint was strict evidence-first movement, not rescue theater. We held to constrained mutation, one-pass validation, and journalized checkpoints because the incident was live and trust was on the line.

The first fracture was not tooling access. Access was proven with reversible write/delete checks. The fracture was runtime truth versus control-plane confidence: wrapper routes answered (`/healthz=200`, `/setup=401`), but `/openclaw` stayed unstable (`503` and `000` timeouts). The next fracture followed rollback: deployment rollback executed successfully but runtime remained unhealthy with the same missing-env signature and config path (`/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json`). A failed assumption collapsed here: rollback at the control plane does not guarantee gateway recovery.

The pivot was dependency-ladder discipline. Instead of broad edits, we removed only hard provider env interpolations in sequence. First, removing `OPENAI_API_KEY` interpolation eliminated that specific missing-env error, then exposed `GEMINI_API_KEY` as the next blocker. Second, removing `GEMINI_API_KEY` interpolation cleared both missing-env signatures in the observed window, gateway became reachable, and `/openclaw` shifted to mostly healthy responses (spot check 10 requests: nine `200`, one transient `502`). This was the earned clarity moment: not random outage, but chained provider dependency failure under incomplete runtime env.

The consequence is now operationally durable. We have a confirmed causal chain, constrained remediation evidence across five deployment journals, and a prevention standard grounded in the failure itself: enforce two-phase provider onboarding (env visibility preflight, then dependency write, then one restart, then health/log verification), and reject config saves that reference unresolved env vars. The emotional shift is measurable in behavior: confusion to control, urgency to method, reaction to governance.

Vector forward is explicit. Before any new OpenClaw inspection planning, synthesis is now complete and audited against manifest/journal/deployment evidence. Next work enters External Codebase Audit mode with Alma treated as peer maintainer. We carry three unresolved threads into the next pass: why runtime continued using `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json` despite state-dir mutation attempts, whether one transient `502` under rapid probing indicates residual warm-up or hidden instability, and where save-time validation should live to prevent unresolved env interpolation from shipping again.
