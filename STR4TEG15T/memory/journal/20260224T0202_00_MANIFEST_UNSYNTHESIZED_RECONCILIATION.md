Tonight we reconciled unsynthesized manifest rounds and converted them into narrative state so they do not roll forward as unresolved memory debt. The pending rounds were R046, R047, R048, and R049. Each had real work completed and none should have remained pending after today.

R046 captured Decision 099 completion, the FireKirin login smoke test gate with zero error builds and full phase structure. R047 captured Decision 101 completion, the missing multiprofile wiring path through H4ND runtime components. R048 captured Decision 109, the correction that stopped hardcoded click behavior from bypassing recorded user steps. R049 captured research assimilation for Decision 110, adding abstraction layer evidence and explicit performance caution to architecture direction.

The emotional reality for today is mixed and honest. We did take a break in the sense that focus fragmented and friend support took center stage, but the day was not empty. We practiced workflow pressure handling, evidence discipline, and post pass reconciliation. We also closed one more gap in synthesis hygiene so future requests start from a cleaner baseline.

Historical context from prior synthesis lineage still applies. The system gets stronger when truth is preserved under stress and weakens when unresolved context accumulates. This reconciliation pass keeps faith with the truth first standard by turning loose operational fragments into durable narrative continuity.

Tomorrow focus should be narrow and deliberate, one primary objective first, then secondary work only after objective lock. The point is not to never help others, the point is to prevent helping others from quietly becoming unbounded scope drift.
