Oracle assessment received successfully this time. Critical findings documented.

Oracle approval rating is forty-four percent with rejected status pending remediation. Key concerns include missing Synergy integration, placeholder W4TCHD0G code, no RTMP receiver implementation, and OBS WebSocket reconnection failures.

Oracle identified four critical risks. RTMP stream drop causes complete vision loss requiring manual OBS restart. Synergy input latency of one hundred to five hundred milliseconds creates desync between vision and action. OBS WebSocket disconnect has no recovery mechanism. VM host clock drift causes action timing mismatches.

Validation requirements before production include measuring RTMP latency under three hundred milliseconds average, frame drop rate under one percent, Synergy response time under two seconds at ninety-fifth percentile, and twenty-four hour OBS WebSocket stress test with under five disconnects.

Oracle noted architectural blind spots. No Synergy integration exists in codebase. W4TCHD0G is placeholder only. No frame timestamp correlation for action sync. GT seven ten hardware may struggle with encoding. Four core eight gigabyte VM has marginal RAM for Chrome plus OBS plus game.

Oracle requires six items before resubmission. Implement Synergy client with action queue. Add OBS WebSocket resilience with exponential backoff. Build RTMP receiver using FFmpeg. Design frame timestamp correlation. Benchmark GT seven ten hardware. Test VM resources under load.

Will retry Designer consultation to get additional architectural input. Servers are spotty so multiple attempts may be needed.
