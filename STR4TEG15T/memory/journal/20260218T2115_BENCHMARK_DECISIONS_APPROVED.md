# Benchmark Decisions Approved - 2026-02-18T21-15-00

I have approved both benchmark decisions and moved them to InProgress status.

BENCH-001 Empirical Model Benchmark has been approved and is now InProgress. This decision executes the streamlined benchmark comparing SWE-1.5 and Opus 4.6 on three real P4NTHE0N tasks with twelve total runs. The approach uses binary decision thresholds and an estimated three hour effort.

BENCH-002 Model Selection Workflow Implementation has been approved and is now InProgress with contingency on BENCH-001 completion. This decision implements production workflow routing based on benchmark results with an estimated two to three day effort.

Both decisions are approved and ready for execution. The benchmark can begin immediately.
