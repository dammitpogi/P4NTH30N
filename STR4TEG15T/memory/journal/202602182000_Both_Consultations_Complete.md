Both Designer and Oracle have completed their consultations on ARCH-003-PIVOT. The plan has been revised and assimilated. Implementation is ready to begin.

Designer rated the revised plan at seventy eight out of one hundred. The approach is sound but needs explicit decision gates. Designer determined that SmolLM two point one seven B is inadequate for standalone production use. The root cause was identified as prompt examples that do not demonstrate rule failures combined with temperature zero point one adding unwanted variance. Even with improvements to temperature and prompts Designer maintains that rule based validation remains necessary.

Oracle rated the hybrid approach at eighty eight out of one hundred and gave final conditional approval at eighty four percent. Oracle required several adjustments to the original plan. The decision gate threshold was raised from sixty percent to seventy percent. Oracle reasoned that sixty percent accuracy means two in five validations could be wrong which is unacceptable for production credential and configuration systems. The new criteria are if SmolLM two point one seven B with temperature zero and improved prompts achieves seventy percent or higher accuracy then keep the LLM as secondary validation with monitoring. If accuracy is between sixty and seventy percent then additional review is required. If accuracy is below sixty percent then fully pivot to pure rule based validation with no LLM secondary.

Oracle also required parallel development to improve timeline safety. While running the SmolLM temperature zero test on days one and two the team should also begin building the Json Schema Validator skeleton. This ensures that if the decision gate fails the project can immediately pivot to pure rule based without losing time. Additionally Oracle mandated safety mechanisms including input sanitization before all processing error logging to the EV three NT collection a circuit breaker that disables the LLM if failure rates exceed ten percent and a manual override flag for ambiguous configurations.

The final architecture is a conditional two stage validation system. Stage one is rule based validation using N Json Schema for structure and C sharp business rules for cross field validation. This covers eighty five percent of cases with less than ten millisecond latency. Stage one can return pass fail or uncertain. Pass and fail are terminal decisions. Uncertain triggers stage two. Stage two is the LLM secondary validation for semantic edge cases only. This covers fifteen percent of cases with approximately eight second latency. The LLM is only invoked when the rule based validator classifies a configuration as uncertain such as when there is a new schema version unknown fields or semantic edge cases that require business judgment.

The hybrid JSON Schema approach uses N Json Schema for eighty percent of validation rules covering structure types required fields and patterns. C sharp business rules handle twenty percent of validation rules covering cross field logic like threshold ordering and platform specific limits. This hybrid provides deterministic one hundred percent accuracy for known rules while maintaining flexibility for complex business logic.

The five day timeline has been revised with parallel development. Days one and two focus on building the Model Testing Platform and investigating SmolLM two point one seven B with temperature zero. The decision gate occurs at the end of day two. Days three and four implement the rule based validator regardless of the decision gate outcome. Day five integrates the two stage pipeline with all required safety mechanisms.

Both consultants agree on the core architecture. The hybrid approach with conditional LLM secondary is approved. Pure rule based validation is an acceptable fallback if the LLM fails the decision gate. The key difference is that Oracle raised the accuracy threshold and added comprehensive safety requirements. Designer focused on the technical architecture while Oracle focused on risk mitigation and production safety.

The decision has been updated with the assimilated plan. All files have been created including the Oracle brief the Designer implementation proposal and the assimilated revised plan document. The path forward is clear. The Model Testing Platform will be built first. SmolLM two point one seven B will be tested with temperature zero and improved prompts. The decision gate will be applied with the seventy percent threshold. Based on the outcome the project will either proceed with hybrid validation or pivot to pure rule based. Either way the safety mechanisms will be in place and the validation pipeline will be production ready.

The consultations are complete. The plan is finalized. Implementation can begin.
