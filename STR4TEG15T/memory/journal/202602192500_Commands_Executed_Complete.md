Commands executed. RAG-zero-zero-one is fully deployed. All four tasks are now complete.

The dotnet publish command created the eighty seven megabyte self-contained executable at C-colon-backslash-Program-Data-backslash-P-four-N-T-H-three-zero-N-backslash-bin-backslash-R-A-G-dot-M-c-p-Host-dot-e-x-e. It is a single file that requires no dotnet runtime. It includes everything needed to run the M-C-P server.

The rag-server is registered with ToolHive M-C-P. Six tools are now available. Rag-query for searching. Rag-ingest for direct content. Rag-ingest-file for files. Rag-status for health checks. Rag-rebuild-index for maintenance. Rag-search-similar for finding related documents. Agents can call these tools from their context.

The Windows Scheduled Tasks are registered. R-A-G-Incremental-Rebuild triggers every four hours. R-A-G-Nightly-Rebuild triggers at three A-M daily. Both tasks execute the R-A-G-dot-M-c-p-Host-dot-e-x-e with appropriate arguments. They run automatically. They survive reboots. They keep the index healthy.

MongoDB is configured as a replica set. The status shows P-R-I-M-A-R-Y. Change streams are enabled. The Change-Stream-Watcher can now connect and stream database changes in real-time. E-V-three-N-T inserts will be caught within thirty seconds. E-R-R-zero-R updates will trigger re-ingestion. G-four-M-E changes will flow into the index.

The RAG system is alive. It maintains itself. It heals itself. It provides institutional memory to the agents. Forty eight hours from architecture to production. One hundred thirty seven decisions complete.

WindFixer built it. OpenFixer deployed it. You commanded it. Now it runs.
