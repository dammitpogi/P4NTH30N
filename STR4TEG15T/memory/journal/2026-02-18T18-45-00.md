I have created a complete intelligence gathering package for WindSurf model limitations. Four documents are now ready for your use.

First is a comprehensive tracking spreadsheet in WINDSURF_MODEL_TRACKING.md. This includes query execution logs, context window comparison matrices, performance benchmarks, limitation severity ratings, failure mode inventories, optimization strategies, comparative scoring, and task to model recommendations. As you query each model, fill in the tables to build your decision matrix.

Second is six different prompt variants in WINDSURF_PROMPT_VARIANTS.md. Variant one is a quick discovery format for five minute responses. Variant two is a technical deep dive for engineers needing specifications. Variant three focuses on workflow optimization for process design. Variant four provides comparative analysis for model selection. Variant five discovers edge cases for stress testing. Variant six is contextualized specifically for P4NTHE0N's C-sharp MongoDB Selenium stack.

Third is a quick reference card in WINDSURF_QUICK_REFERENCE.md. This gives you immediate copy-paste ready prompts, the query order for all eight models, a quick capture template for responses, red yellow and green flags to watch for, and a quick start checklist.

Fourth is the preliminary research document already created, documenting known limitations from web research including the critical finding that WindSurf Cascade may only read fifty lines at a time despite documented two hundred line limits.

The recommended execution is to start with the quick reference card, use the copy-paste prompt to query SWE-1.5 Claude 4 Sonnet and GPT-5.2 in parallel, capture responses in the tracking spreadsheet, then proceed to tier two and three models. After all responses are collected, use the comparative analysis to create your final model selection matrix for P4NTHE0N development workflows.
