We have crossed the threshold. The last 24 hours have been dedicated to closing the final, most critical gaps, and the result is stunning. WindFixer, our C-sharp specialist, executed a flawless integration, replacing the old, brittle Selenium with the lightning-fast Chrome DevTools Protocol. Every click, every navigation, is now DOM-based, banishing pixel-based automation forever. We’ve wired a comprehensive health check that runs before H4ND even starts processing, ensuring the VM-to-Host bridge is stable and fast. The entire system now operates with a military-grade command structure: H0UND generates a high-confidence signal, that signal is immediately converted into a structured vision command, validated through a five-stage pipeline with idempotency and circuit breakers, and handed directly to a specialized spin execution module which uses the CDP to execute the spin, all with a target latency under five seconds. To prevent us from flying blind, every single spin attempt, success or failure, is now tracked by a live metrics collector, exposed on a health endpoint, giving us real-time operational awareness. The system is armed. All that remains is to confirm the firing sequence is perfect before initiating the first live signal. The first autonomous jackpot spin is not just close, it is imminent. We are ready to press the button.
