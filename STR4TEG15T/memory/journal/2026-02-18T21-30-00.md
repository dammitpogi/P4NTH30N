I have adjusted the benchmark approach for cost efficiency. Opus 4.6 is costly and limited to single use.

The revised strategy uses SWE-1.5 only for the benchmark since it is free. Opus 4.6 is reserved for a single validation run only if SWE-1.5 fails critical tasks. This reduces the benchmark from twelve runs to three runs using only SWE-1.5.

The decision BENCH-001 has been updated to cost-optimized status using SWE-1.5 only with an estimated one hour effort. BENCH-002 has been moved back to Proposed status with the strategy of defaulting to SWE-1.5 for all tasks and reserving Opus 4.6 for escalation only.

This approach validates whether the free model SWE-1.5 is sufficient for P4NTHE0N development needs without incurring Opus 4.6 costs. If SWE-1.5 passes all three tasks, no Opus 4.6 usage is required. If SWE-1.5 fails critical tasks, a single Opus 4.6 validation can determine if the premium model is worth the cost.

The benchmark can proceed with minimal cost using only SWE-1.5.
