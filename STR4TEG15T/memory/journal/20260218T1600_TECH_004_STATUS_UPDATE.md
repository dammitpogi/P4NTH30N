# TECH-004 Status Update - 2026-02-18T16-00-00

TECH-004 decisions-server tool enhancement status update. Oracle assessment complete with sixty percent conditional approval increasing to eighty-five percent with safeguards implemented. Five action items added addressing all Oracle concerns.

Designer consultation attempted multiple times. Server connectivity issues prevented response. Decision made to proceed with Oracle-approved architecture rather than block implementation. Designer feedback can be integrated in version two if architectural adjustments needed.

Oracle conditions include JSON persistence instead of database atomic file writes for transaction safety path validation for security hardening severity tiered validation with blocking warning and info levels and comprehensive unit tests before enhancement.

Total decisions now forty-six with seventy-seven action items. Fixer can query TECH-004 via decisions-server for complete specifications. Ready for implementation using Oracle-approved approach.
