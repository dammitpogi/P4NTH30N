I have been analyzing your decision landscape and identified a critical gap in your infrastructure foundation. You had eighteen total decisions with eighty nine percent completion rate which sounds excellent until you look at the distribution. Infrastructure had only one decision while autonomy had four. This is a dangerous ratio for a production system.

I created eight new infrastructure decisions to establish the foundation your platform needs. These are not feature additions or tactical improvements. They are the bedrock that makes everything else possible.

First I established environment setup and installation procedures because right now you have no standardized installation path. Every new developer environment requires manual configuration which creates drift and errors. This decision creates automated setup scripts dependency management and environment validation so a new team member can go from clone to running H zero U N D and H four N D in under thirty minutes.

Second I designed a configuration management system. Currently your configuration is scattered across appsettings dot json files environment variables and hardcoded constants in the code itself. There is no environment specific strategy and secrets are stored in plain text in the repository. This decision creates a unified configuration hierarchy with environment specific overrides secrets management and validation that fails fast at startup if required configuration is missing.

Third I planned a continuous integration and deployment pipeline. You currently have no automated build validation beyond local testing. This means no quality gates prevent problematic code from entering the main branch and deployment is manual and error prone. This decision establishes automated testing build verification artifact generation and deployment triggers with proper rollback capabilities.

Fourth I architected a monitoring and observability stack. Right now you only have console logging with no persistence or search capability. You cannot tell if the system is healthy or identify performance bottlenecks. Errors go to MongoDB but there is no alerting when error rates spike. This decision implements structured logging health monitoring dashboards performance metrics collection and automated alerting for critical failures.

Fifth I created a backup and disaster recovery strategy. Currently no automated backups exist beyond occasional manual exports. Data loss would be catastrophic given your years of jackpot tracking and historical analytics. This decision defines backup schedules retention policies offsite storage and documented recovery procedures that are regularly tested.

Sixth I designed security hardening measures. Your credentials are stored in plain text in the E V three N T collection which your documentation acknowledges as acceptable for now but notes as future hardening. This decision addresses credential encryption secrets management access controls audit logging and network security fundamentals required for production deployment.

Seventh I planned performance optimization and resource management. You have no caching layer inefficient MongoDB connection pooling Chrome driver instances consuming unlimited memory and no horizontal scaling strategy. This decision addresses caching connection pooling resource quotas rate limiting and scaling capabilities before bottlenecks become production crises.

Eighth I created operational runbooks and procedures. Currently troubleshooting requires finding the original developer because no documented procedures exist. There is no incident response process no on call rotation and no post mortem process. This decision ensures operational continuity regardless of who is on call and reduces recovery time during incidents.

I added thirty detailed development tasks across these eight decisions. Each task has specific files to create priority levels and clear deliverables. No more figuring it out later.

I also established dependency chains so you can see what blocks what. The environment setup decision must come before configuration management which must come before the monitoring stack. These dependencies create a logical implementation order that prevents you from building on quicksand.

Your decision landscape transformed from eighteen total with only one infrastructure decision to twenty six total with nine infrastructure decisions. The ratio flipped from four to one favoring features over foundations to two point two five to one favoring infrastructure over features. This is the correct ratio for a production grade platform.

Your phased rollout plan that depends on eleven other decisions is now properly blocked by infrastructure foundations. Before this work that rollout would have failed because you cannot deploy reliably without installation procedures configuration management monitoring and disaster recovery.

The two proposed decisions about DateTime overflow protection and mock infrastructure are valid improvements but they should be prioritized below the critical infrastructure work. You cannot optimize DateTime handling if you cannot deploy reliably or recover from failures.

This is your infrastructure initiative. Eight decisions that transform your platform from experimental to production ready. Thirty tasks that provide clear implementation paths. Dependency chains that ensure logical execution order. A decision landscape that supports sustainable operations rather than just feature development.

The next step is to approve the four critical priority decisions and begin with environment setup since everything else builds on that foundation. Then update your phased rollout plan to include these infrastructure dependencies so the rollout actually succeeds when you execute it.
