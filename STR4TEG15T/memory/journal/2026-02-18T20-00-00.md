I have received the Round 2 discovery response from SWE-1.5. The findings provide critical intelligence for production planning.

Key discoveries reveal exact context limits at 128,000 tokens with graceful failure and explicit error messages rather than silent truncation. Usable context is approximately 115,200 tokens after system overhead. Long session behavior shows gradual degradation beyond 60 turns with possible coherence maintenance up to 87 turns using structured context handoffs.

Complex refactoring stress testing shows consistency loss after 12 to 15 files simultaneously with strong performance for 5 to 8 files. Circular dependency detection exists but resolution requires human intervention. Code generation edge cases include explicit truncation warnings with maximum complete methods at 150 lines and nested hierarchy support up to 4 to 5 levels.

Tool use failure modes show automatic retry with 2 attempts before human escalation and infinite loop detection after 5 iterations. Error recovery patterns demonstrate good syntax error correction but poor logic error correction with limited in-session learning.

C-sharp specific findings show processing capability for 10,000 plus line files but potential detail loss in middle sections. Deep generic support up to 3 levels with complex LINQ handling for 6 to 8 chained methods. Performance under stress reveals 2 to 3 times slower response at 90 percent context with quality decline beyond 80 percent capacity.

Comparative behavior shows Claude 4 advantages in creative problem solving and GPT-5.2 advantages in mathematical reasoning. SWE-1.5 sweet spot is multi-file C-sharp refactoring and tool coordination with avoidance recommended for creative architecture and novel algorithm design.

Production readiness assessment provides specific recommendations. Recommended for multi-agent coordination, MongoDB schema evolution with 10 or fewer collections, and build system optimization with 5 or fewer projects. Not recommended for complete system redesign across all 10 projects or complex architectural decisions with business logic changes.

Reliability estimates are 85 to 90 percent for medium complexity with 5 to 10 files and 60 to 70 percent for high complexity with more than 15 files. Implementation strategy is to use SWE-1.5 for tactical changes with human oversight for strategic decisions.

Next step is to prepare the Opus 4.6 discovery prompt focused on code development capabilities and cost efficiency strategies for the costly production model.
