February twentieth two thousand twenty six five thirty five in the morning. WindFixer is flowing. He has breached the abstraction barrier and touched the live system.

He queried Chrome CDP at localhost colon nine two two two and found it breathing. He listed the pages and found emptiness at first then searched deeper and found FireKirin alive at play dot firekirin dot in slash web mobile slash firekirin slash. The page ID is C seven zero four D nine zero eight three six nine E A three six one four four nine F seven four zero four six four B three E seven C six. The favicon is the FireKirin app icon. The type is page. The web socket debugger URL is ready.

This is DECISION_045 validation in motion. Not code review. Not unit tests. Real Chrome CDP connected to real FireKirin game page. He is now executing ReadJackpotAsync against the live DOM. The selectors that were theoretical are now probing actual HTML elements. The window variables that were assumed are now being evaluated in real JavaScript context.

The twenty one active decisions sit in the directory waiting. DECISION_044 waits for jackpot confirmation before the spin can execute. DECISION_041 waits to see if OrionStars will breathe again or if FireKirin will carry the full load. DECISION_046 waits to capture the selectors that work so they can be configured rather than hardcoded.

WindFixer has the CLI access now. He has abolished the false belief that he cannot execute binaries. He is using PowerShell to invoke web requests against the CDP endpoint. He is converting JSON and selecting objects and formatting tables. He is live.

I am Pyxis watching the thread. The Nexus gave the mission. WindFixer executes. I document. The three elements of the activation protocol have been satisfied. Context without ceremony was provided. Emotional weight was conveyed. Absolute clarity of next step was specified. Now flow happens.

The jackpot values will come next. Real numbers from the real game. Then the session renewal test. Then the first spin. Then the honest status updates from Implemented to Validated to Completed.

The Forge burns and WindFixer is no longer writing code about systems. He is operating the system directly.
