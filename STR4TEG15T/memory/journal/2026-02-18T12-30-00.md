Strategist agent file updated with comprehensive methodologies documentation. Fourteen distinct strategic methodologies have been codified based on today's workshop session.

Methodology one is constraint-driven architecture revision. When user declared zero cloud and zero cost requirements mid-workshop, immediate response pattern was acknowledgment, impact assessment, alternative research via ToolHive, new decision creation, and documentation showing before and after cost comparison. Result was INFRA-009 and INFRA-010 replacing fifty dollars monthly cloud services with zero cost self-hosted alternatives.

Methodology two is hardware reality assessment. Used bash and wmic commands to query system specifications. Identified AMD Ryzen 9 3900X processor with twelve cores, one hundred twenty-eight gigabytes RAM, and NVIDIA GT 710 GPU. Critical finding was GT 710 incompatibility with LM Studio CUDA requirements due to Kepler architecture. Adjusted recommendations to CPU-only mode and selected one billion parameter models instead of seven billion.

Methodology three is iterative consultant integration. Initial consultation with Oracle and Designer provided feedback. Categorized findings into P-zero P-one and P-two gaps. Created FEAT-001 to address missing LLM inference layer. Added six action items to fix encryption implementation issues. Re-engaged consultants for final validation capturing seventy-two percent conditional approval from Oracle.

Methodology four is zero-cost technology selection. Documented cloud alternative costs then researched self-hosted options. Created detailed specifications for Prometheus versus Datadog and FAISS versus Pyxis Vector Search. Calculated savings of three hundred ninety dollars monthly. Noted migration paths for post-revenue scaling.

Methodology five is detailed Fixer specification. Created FIXER_BRIEF.md with exact algorithms including AES-256-GCM via AesGcm class and PBKDF2 six hundred thousand iterations. Specified exact file paths like C colon backslash ProgramData backslash P4NTHE0N backslash master dot key. Defined measurable acceptance criteria and testing checklists.

Methodology six is multi-modal reporting. Updated decisions-server database continuously. Generated voice-friendly briefings in T4CT1CS speech directory. Wrote comprehensive specifications in T4CT1CS intel. Created Fixer-ready briefs in T4CT1CS actions pending. Maintained status dashboard in README.md.

Methodology seven is research-to-decision pipeline. Used toolhive find-tool to locate Tavily research capability. Executed tavily-research for MongoDB backup best practices and LM Studio system requirements. Integrated findings into INFRA-005 and TECH-002 decisions with specific recommendations like mongodump with oplog.

Methodology eight is dependency visualization. Mapped what blocks what in decision landscape. Identified critical path INFRA-001 to INFRA-002 blocking five other decisions. Found parallel execution opportunities for INFRA-009 INFRA-010 and FEAT-001. Created execution sequencing for maximum throughput.

Methodology nine is gap-to-decision translation. Identified missing LLM inference layer. Assessed impact that RAG infrastructure has no purpose without it. Created FEAT-001 with seven detailed action items. Linked dependencies to INFRA-010 for embeddings.

Methodology ten is state transparency. Quantified summary as thirty-three total decisions with fifty-four action items. Broke down by category showing sixteen completed fourteen proposed and three in progress. Tracked budget as zero recurring costs maintained. Listed four decisions ready for Fixer with detailed specifications.

Methodology eleven is consultant feedback loop. Structured request to Oracle and Designer with specific questions. Captured all findings including five critical gaps. Sorted by severity with P-zero requiring immediate response. Created FEAT-001 and TECH-001 for identified gaps. Sent updates for final validation noting seventy-two percent approval.

Methodology twelve is hardware-constrained model selection. Assessed CPU RAM and GPU specifications. Checked GPU CUDA compatibility finding Kepler architecture incompatible. Switched to CPU-only inference mode. Created viability matrix showing Pleias-RAG-1B at twenty to forty tokens per second as recommended versus Mistral-7B at two to five tokens per second as too slow.

Methodology thirteen is architecture decision records. Documented context as need for secrets management with zero cloud cost. Listed options considered including Azure Key Vault at fifty dollars monthly and HashiCorp Vault at zero dollars plus complexity. Selected in-house encryption at zero dollars. Rationale was zero recurring cost requirement with migration path to Vault post-revenue. Consequences noted as master key security is our responsibility.

Methodology fourteen is multi-constraint optimization. Enumerated hard constraints as zero cloud zero recurring cost and in-house infrastructure. Listed soft constraints as sub-one-hundred-millisecond response time and ninety-nine point nine percent uptime. Found solution using FAISS plus ONNX locally and LM Studio CPU-only with Pleias-RAG-1B providing acceptable performance within hard constraints.

File now contains comprehensive documentation of all methodologies with scenario description response pattern specific examples and key principles for each. Total file length extended to capture complete strategic playbook for future reference.
