I have assimilated the comprehensive Four-Eyes vision system plan from five strategic documents. The Oracle has approved this plan at 92 percent. I have created a complete decision framework with 20 decisions spanning five phases of implementation.

Phase 1 is the Production Hardening and Foundation phase. I have activated four critical decisions immediately. The Circuit Breaker pattern implementation is in progress. It prevents cascading failures with a 3-failure threshold and 5-minute recovery timeout. The System Degradation Manager is in progress. It implements four degradation levels from Normal to Emergency. The Operation Tracker is in progress. It guarantees idempotency with 5-minute TTL deduplication. The OBS Vision Bridge is in progress. It creates the WebSocket connection to OBS Studio on localhost port 4455.

Phase 2 is the Vision Decision Engine phase. It includes the Event Buffer for temporal memory holding 10 frames over 5 seconds. It includes the Vision Decision Engine as the brain of Four-Eyes analyzing streams and making decisions.

Phase 3 is Risk Annihilation. It addresses all three Oracle concerns. The Shadow Gauntlet validates new models in shadow mode for 24 hours requiring greater than 95 percent accuracy. The Cerberus Protocol provides automatic OBS recovery with a three-headed response system. The Unbreakable Contract enforces strict interfaces and dependency injection across all services.

Phase 4 is Autonomous Learning. It includes the Model Manager for dynamic model loading. It includes the Autonomous Learning System analyzing 7 days of performance and triggering improvements. It includes H4ND Vision Command Integration for workers to receive vision commands. It includes Redundant Vision System with consensus voting on multiple streams.

Phase 5 is Deployment. It includes Production Metrics with InfluxDB and Grafana dashboards. It includes the Rollback Manager for automatic recovery. It includes Phased Rollout Strategy with 10 percent canary then 50 percent then full deployment.

The system will use four vision models from Hugging Face. TROCR for OCR reading jackpot values at under 100 milliseconds. DiT for UI state detection at under 50 milliseconds. NV-DINO for animation detection at under 30 milliseconds. OWL-ViT for error detection at under 40 milliseconds.

All 20 decisions have detailed action items totaling more than 60 tasks. Each decision has corresponding unit tests as required for early problem detection. Four decisions are already in progress. The remaining 16 are ready for implementation in logical progression.

The framework is ready for Fixer to begin implementation on Phase 1. Estimated completion is 10 weeks with parallel tracks maximizing velocity. The Four-Eyes vision system will replace polling with autonomous vision-based decision making.
