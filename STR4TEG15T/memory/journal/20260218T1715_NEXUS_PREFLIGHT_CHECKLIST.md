# Nexus Preflight Checklist - 2026-02-18T17-15-00

Nexus pre-flight checklist created. Fixer cannot change WindSurf settings. Nexus must configure permissions before Fixer begins.

Three documents ready for Fixer deployment.

FIXER_PROMPT dot m d contains comprehensive instructions for Fixer agent. Covers scope of work including all thirty-nine active decisions. Priority order from infrastructure through FourEyes to WIN phase. Build standards requiring defensive programming thorough comments and production quality. Autonomous operation rules specifying when to proceed versus when to stop. Implementation workflow with decision queries coding standards and status updates.

WINDSURF_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE dot m d explains all settings Nexus must configure. Terminal auto execution must be set to Turbo mode. Gitignore access toggle must be enabled. MCP servers must be verified as connected. Specific settings JSON provided for copy paste into WindSurf.

NEXUS_PREFLIGHT dot m d is the actionable checklist. Step one configure WindSurf settings with specific values. Step two verify permissions by running test commands without prompts. Step three confirm MCP servers active. Step four load Fixer context with mission statement. Step five execute and monitor.

Critical distinction documented. Fixer can read write code files execute terminal commands query decisions-server and update decision status. Fixer cannot change WindSurf settings access gitignored files without Nexus enabling toggle or install new MCP servers.

Ready state requires Nexus to complete five step pre-flight checklist. Once configured Nexus says Go Fixer and autonomous implementation begins.
