I have received the Designer's comprehensive benchmark protocol while the Oracle task hung. The Designer has provided an extensive empirical benchmark framework for comparing SWE-1.5 and Opus 4.6.

The protocol includes five specific P4NTHE0N tasks across complexity levels. Task one is low complexity single method refactor of Thresholds.cs to primary constructor syntax. Task two is medium complexity five-file feature addition implementing a new Mega jackpot tier. Task three is medium-high complexity cross-project bug fix for DPD weighted average calculation. Task four is high complexity API design decision for GameVault platform with streaming support. Task five is very high complexity refactoring migrating validation to ValidationPipeline decorator pattern across minimum ten files.

Measurable metrics are defined across six categories. Correctness metrics include build success rate, test pass rate, and runtime validation. Completeness metrics include requirements coverage, file coverage, and documentation completeness. Time metrics include total wall-clock time, time to first valid output, and interaction round count. Cost metrics include input token count, output token count, and estimated cost in USD. Code quality metrics include format compliance, lint compliance, and pattern consistency.

Controlled test conditions specify environment standardization with same starting state, same tool access, and same runtime environment. Prompt standardization requires identical task prompts, same context injection, and same output format expectations. Evaluation criteria consistency mandates same rubric application, blinded review where possible, and same test execution.

The evaluation methodology includes build validation procedure, test execution procedure, requirements checklist development, token counting, cost estimation formula, and statistical significance requirements with minimum sample size of three attempts per model per task.

Expected outcome matrix provides hypotheses for each task complexity level. Low complexity tasks expect SWE-1.5 success above ninety percent. Medium complexity expects seventy-five to eighty-five percent. Medium-high expects sixty to seventy percent. High expects fifty to sixty percent. Very high expects below forty percent.

Architecture recommendations include workflow partitioning strategy with three tiers. Tier one is SWE-1.5 exclusive for single file bug fixes, documentation, simple refactoring, and test additions. Tier two is SWE-1.5 primary with Opus 4.6 escalation for multi-file features with triggers for build failures or low completeness. Tier three is Opus 4.6 exclusive for API design, large-scale refactoring, and architectural changes.

Fallback mechanisms specify automatic fallback protocol, context preservation when escalating, and escalation metrics tracking. Cost optimization patterns include batching similar tasks, template-based prompts, context caching, and hybrid review model.

Quality assurance integration requires pre-commit validation with build checks, mandatory test coverage for new features, and code review requirements scaling with model and complexity.

The Oracle task hung and did not complete. We have comprehensive benchmark design from the Designer. Options are to proceed with Designer protocol, retry Oracle with simplified validation request, or proceed directly to benchmark execution.
