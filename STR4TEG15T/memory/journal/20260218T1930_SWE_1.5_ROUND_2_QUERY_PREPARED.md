# SWE-1.5 Round 2 Query Prepared - 2026-02-18T19-30-00

I have prepared the second round discovery query for SWE-1.5. This focuses on edge cases, stress testing, and failure modes that were not covered in round one.

The query investigates ten critical areas. Exact context limits at the 128,000 token boundary and whether failure is graceful or silent. Long session behavior beyond 60 turns and coherence maintenance across 100 plus turns. Complex refactoring stress testing with 20 plus files and cross-file dependency handling. Code generation edge cases including truncation signaling and maximum method length. Tool use failure modes with multiple simultaneous failures and retry behavior. Error recovery patterns and self-correction capabilities. C-sharp specific edge cases with large files and complex generics. Performance under stress at different context utilization levels. Comparative behavior against Claude and GPT models. Production readiness including monitoring recommendations and reliability estimates.

A quick stress test alternative is also provided with eight focused questions if you prefer shorter discovery.

The discovery goals are to determine exact failure modes, maximum reliable file counts, truncation signaling behavior, tool failure recovery patterns, self-correction capabilities, C-sharp edge case handling, performance degradation curves, comparative weaknesses, and production reliability percentages.

Green light scenarios would include graceful degradation, clear error signaling, successful multi-file coordination, automatic recovery, and self-correction. Red light scenarios would include silent truncation, session crashes, inconsistent edits, infinite loops, and no error recovery.

Post-discovery actions will only occur after all rounds are complete. Compile findings, make go or no-go decision, then and only then create decisions if appropriate, or research alternatives if not. Document production guidelines based on actual observed limits rather than documented specifications.

Send this prompt to SWE-1.5 to complete the discovery phase.
