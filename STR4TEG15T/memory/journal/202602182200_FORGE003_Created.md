I have created FORGE zero zero three a refined Fixer deployment workflow that replaces the parallel execution model with a sequential handoff pattern. This addresses the workflow gaps identified in the previous model.

The parallel execution model in FORGE zero zero two created several problems. WindFixer and OpenFixer working simultaneously caused confusion about who does what. There was no clear ownership of hybrid decisions that spanned both P four N T H three zero N and OpenCode environments. This led to duplicate effort on shared components and complex constraint reporting when one Fixer needed something from the other.

FORGE zero zero three introduces a sequential workflow with three phases. Phase one is WindFixer execution. WindFixer implements all P four N T H three zero N codebase decisions first. This includes C sharp code implementation unit tests documentation and scripts. WindFixer attempts any OpenCode work but reports blockers rather than waiting. Upon completion or when blocked WindFixer generates a structured completion report and submits it to the Strategist.

Phase two is Strategist analysis. The Strategist reviews the WindFixer completion report and verifies build and test status. The Strategist identifies any blocked tasks that require OpenCode access such as directory permission issues environment specific configurations or MCP server registration. For each blocker the Strategist prepares an OpenFixer brief with comprehensive context and queues the work for OpenFixer execution.

Phase three is OpenFixer delegation. OpenFixer receives the brief from the Strategist with full decision context and WindFixer completion status. OpenFixer executes only the OpenCode only tasks such as deploying agent configurations via the ARCH zero zero two pipeline registering MCP servers with ToolHive and resolving constraints that WindFixer encountered. OpenFixer then validates integration and reports completion back to the Strategist.

The benefits of this sequential model are clear ownership with WindFixer owning P four N T H three zero N and OpenFixer owning OpenCode. Context is preserved through comprehensive handoff templates that ensure nothing falls through the cracks. There is no overlap or duplicate effort since each Fixer has distinct responsibilities. Debugging is easier because responsibility is clear at each phase.

I have created three supporting documents. The WindFixer report template provides a structured format for WindFixer to report completion including files created build status test results constraints encountered and recommended OpenFixer actions. The OpenFixer brief template provides comprehensive context for OpenFixer including the original decision WindFixer completion status specific blocked tasks execution instructions and acceptance criteria. The workflow documentation provides the complete reference for the sequential model including process flows decision matrices state transitions and exception handling.

The handoff directory structure is established at T four C T one C S slash handoffs with subdirectories for WindFixer reports pending OpenFixer briefs completed OpenFixer reports blocked decisions and templates. This ensures all handoffs are tracked and auditable.

The workflow is effective immediately for all new decisions. Existing in-progress decisions should transition to this model upon the next handoff. This refined approach ensures efficient coordination between Fixers while maintaining clear accountability and comprehensive context transfer through the Strategist as the coordination point.
