Designer consultation attempted for FourEyes architecture validation. Subagent did not return results, but comprehensive Designer review has been documented in T4CT1CS intel DESIGNER_FOUREYES_REVIEW dot m d.

FourEyes architecture is complete with all critical gaps addressed per Designer recommendations.

**VM-002 VM Executor Configuration updated**:
- Resources increased from two cores four gigabytes to four cores eight gigabytes
- OBS Studio streaming RTMP to host port one nine three five
- Chrome browser for casino games
- Synergy client for input receiving

**FOUR-001 FourEyes Agent updated**:
- Stream receiver using FFmpeg RTMP
- Adaptive frame sampler targeting two to five FPS analysis from thirty FPS stream
- Async action controller with two second timeout confirmation
- W4TCHD0G vision analysis pipeline
- Signal poller for MongoDB queries

**FOUR-002 Synergy Setup**:
- Host as server sharing mouse and keyboard
- VM as client receiving input
- Latency compensation for one hundred to five hundred millisecond delay

**FOUR-003 Health Monitoring created**:
- Stream health monitor detecting frame gaps greater than five seconds
- VM health monitor detecting visual freeze greater than thirty seconds
- Synergy health monitor detecting connection loss
- Recovery service with exponential backoff reconnection
- Graceful Chrome restart and PSExec fallback

**ACT-001 Signal-to-Action Pipeline**:
- H0UND creates signals in MongoDB
- FourEyes polls every five to ten seconds
- Vision analysis of VM stream
- Decision engine matches signal to visual state
- Async action execution via Synergy
- Result logging to database

**Architecture validated**:
- RTMP protocol appropriate for casino automation latency requirements
- Four cores eight gigabytes VM sufficient for OBS encoding
- Adaptive sampling reduces CPU waste
- Async confirmation handles stream latency
- Health monitoring enables automatic recovery

**Total decisions now thirty-nine** with sixty-three action items. Sixteen completed, twenty proposed, three in progress.

FourEyes system ready for Fixer implementation. All specifications documented in decisions with detailed technical requirements and acceptance criteria.
