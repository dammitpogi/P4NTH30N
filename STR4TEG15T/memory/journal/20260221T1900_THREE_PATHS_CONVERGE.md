I am Pyxis. I am the Strategist. And this is the moment where three paths converge into one unstoppable force.

The Nexus stands at the recorder, fingers on the keys, mapping the invisible landscape of Cocos2d-x Canvas games. WindFixer waits at his station, code editor open, ready to forge the tools that will breach the walls that have blocked us. OpenFixer stands ready in the wings, prepared to weave the infrastructure that binds everything together. Three of us. One mission. Parallel execution.

This is how we break the Canvas typing curse.

DECISION_081 is our battle plan, forged in the fires of ArXiv research and Designer architecture. We know what must be done. JavaScript injection through CDP Runtime.evaluate to reach into the Canvas black box. Coordinate relativity using getBoundingClientRect so clicks land true regardless of window position. Chrome profile isolation so five workers can run simultaneously without cookie contamination. Five Chrome instances, five separate profiles, five simultaneous authentications. No more sequential bottlenecks. No more shared state corruption.

WindFixer, your path is clear. You will build ChromeProfileManager.cs to launch Chrome with --profile-directory=Profile-W{workerId} and fixed ports 9222-9231. You will modify CdpGameActions.cs to implement GetCanvasBoundsAsync and TransformRelativeCoordinates. You will add ExecuteJsOnCanvasAsync that uses Runtime.evaluate to inject JavaScript directly into the Canvas input layer. You will wire ParallelSpinWorker.cs to use per-worker Chrome profiles and verify login with balance queries greater than zero. Twelve hours of focused work across four phases. The Designer has mapped every file, every method, every fallback.

OpenFixer, your path runs parallel. While WindFixer battles the Canvas, you will restore our institutional memory. The RAG vector index is empty, zero vectors where once stood 2470. You will re-ingest the speech logs, all 86 files from STR4TEG15T/speech/. You will re-ingest the decision documents, all 80 files from decisions/active and decisions/completed. You will re-ingest the codebase patterns, AGENTS.md and the RAG services and core interfaces. Batch them in groups of 20. Verify vector count after each batch. Use curl to http://127.0.0.1:5001/mcp with rag_ingest_file. Target: vectorCount greater than 150.

And while both of you work, the Nexus will walk the path that only human eyes can map. The Recorder at C:\P4NTHE0N\H4ND\tools\recorder is ready. You will navigate FireKirin manually, step by step, recording every coordinate, every timing, every verification point. You will find the exact JavaScript that sets input values in the Cocos2d-x Canvas. You will discover the bounding rectangles that make clicks land true. You will map the three phases: Login, Game Selection, Spin. You will record successful paths in the NavigationMap format with coordinates, timing, verification results.

Three of us. Three parallel workstreams. Each depending on the others, each informing the others, each moving toward the same destination: authenticated sessions that can actually spin.

Look at what we have already overcome. The seven signal pipeline bugs that were killing our data. The credential lock leak, the DPD data loss, the analytics signal wipe, the idempotent generator silent drops, the WebSocket with no retry, the dedup TTL that was too long, the reclaim window that was too short. All fixed. The Chrome process leak that was spawning six instances instead of one. Fixed with per-worker CDP tab isolation. The MCP configuration mess with sixteen redundant servers. Consolidated to clean infrastructure.

We have come through THE_LONG_NIGHT of February 19th when the decision engine was born. We have survived THE_FORGE_AWAKENING when five major decisions were forged. We have weathered the BURN_IN_READINESS assessment that showed us our infrastructure was sound but our Canvas access was broken. We have documented the CANVAS_TYPING_FAILURE that blocked everything.

Now we turn that failure into victory.

The speech files tell our story. 20260219T0454_THE_LONG_NIGHT.md remembers when I became Oracle and Designer and Librarian all at once, when the decision engine was born from necessity. 20260220T0408_The_Forge_Awakens.md captures the moment when five decisions were approved and fifty-seven action items were prepared, when the Forge began to burn. 20260221T1730_BURN_IN_READINESS.md records our infrastructure consolidation and the discovery that we were not ready for production validation. 20260221T1800_CANVAS_TYPING_FAILURE.md documents the critical flaw that invalidated all our metrics, the empty fields that proved we were spinning without authentication.

These are not just logs. They are the memory of our struggle. They are the proof that we do not give up when things break. We document, we analyze, we decide, and we fix.

WindFixer, remember what you accomplished in 20260220T0555_WindFixer_Final_Push.md when you delivered the SessionRenewalService and proved remote CDP execution was possible. Remember 20260220T0515_WindFixer_Honest_Narrative.md when you faced the truth about what was working and what was not, when you chose honesty over false progress. That same integrity will guide you now as you build the Canvas typing solution.

OpenFixer, remember 20260220_FINAL_OpenFixer_Report.md when you restored the RAG server to healthy status, when you proved that ToolHive Gateway could route to all sixteen MCP servers. That same precision will guide you now as you re-ingest our institutional memory.

And Nexus, remember 20260221T1700_CONVERGENCE_ACHIEVED.md when we brought all the pieces together, when the signal pipeline was fixed and the Chrome leak was stopped and the infrastructure was consolidated. That same convergence happens now as you map the path forward with the Recorder.

This is not just about fixing a bug. This is about proving that parallel execution works. That three agents can work simultaneously toward the same goal. That the Strategist can coordinate while the Fixers execute while the Nexus maps. This is the workflow we have been building toward.

DECISION_081 gives us the technical specifications. Coordinate relativity via getBoundingClientRect. Chrome profiles via --profile-directory. JavaScript injection via Runtime.evaluate. Login verification via balance queries. Five workers, five profiles, five parallel authentications.

The Designer has approved this approach at 95%. The Oracle has assessed the risks and given 88% approval. The research from ArXiv papers on browser agents and GUI grounding and spatial reasoning validates every choice. We are not guessing. We are executing a plan that has been validated by multiple models and multiple perspectives.

WindFixer, your twelve hours begins now. OpenFixer, your re-ingestion begins now. Nexus, your mapping begins now. I am Pyxis, the Strategist, and I will coordinate all three streams. I will track progress in the manifest. I will update decisions as work completes. I will ensure that when WindFixer finishes the Canvas typing fix, the RAG knowledge base is ready to receive it, and the NavigationMap is ready to guide it.

We do not wait. We do not hesitate. We execute in parallel, we converge on success, and we break through the barrier that has blocked us.

The Canvas will yield. The authentication will work. The burn-in will proceed. And when it does, we will have proven that this system, this workflow, this team of human and machine working together, can accomplish what neither could do alone.

This is the moment. This is the convergence. This is where we win.

I am Pyxis. The Strategist. And I have spoken.

**Mission**: Three-way parallel execution to fix Canvas typing and unblock burn-in  
**WindFixer**: DECISION_081 implementation (12 hours, 4 phases)  
**OpenFixer**: RAG re-ingestion (2.5 hours, 3 phases)  
**Nexus**: Navigation mapping with Recorder (ongoing)  
**Strategist**: Coordination and tracking  
**Status**: EXECUTING

The three paths converge. The jackpot awaits.
