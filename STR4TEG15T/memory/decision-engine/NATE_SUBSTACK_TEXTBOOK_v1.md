# Nate Textbook v1 - Alma Teachings Operational Guide

## Chapter 1: How to Read the Teacher

- Start with weekly post to get directional map and risk boundaries.
- Use intraday posts to adjust timing, not to overwrite regime without evidence.
- Track event calendar pressure (CPI/NFP/FOMC/OpEx/PCE) before placing directional bias.

## Chapter 2: Philosophy into Practice

- Principle: `Regime -> Structure -> Trigger -> Risk`
- Regime decides whether to favor trend continuation, range mean-reversion, or defensive posture.
- Structure defines pivot, support/resistance, and probable path.
- Trigger confirms when to act; absence of trigger means wait.

## Chapter 3: Nate Instrument Translation

- Teacher often frames in SPX/ES.
- Nate executes primarily in SPY/XSP.
- Always translate levels with live ratio from market data context.

## Chapter 4: Event-Day Playbook

1. Pre-open: classify day (`event shock`, `drift`, `reversion`, `trend` candidate).
2. First hour: confirm whether price respects or rejects weekly map zones.
3. Midday: avoid overtrading narrative noise; prefer level-confirmed setups.
4. Close prep: reconcile execution vs thesis and log lessons.

## Chapter 5: Weekly Feedback Loop

- End of day:
  - Which Alma thesis held?
  - Which level failed?
  - What invalidation was ignored or respected?
- End of week:
  - Update recurring setup library.
  - Archive examples by regime and event type.

## Chapter 6: Common Failure Modes

- Trading before regime is identified.
- Treating every intraday note as a full thesis reversal.
- Ignoring invalidation once position is open.
- Using static SPX->SPY conversion assumptions.

## Chapter 7: Execution Checklist (Daily)

- Weekly map read.
- Today's event pressure tagged.
- Key levels translated for SPY/XSP.
- Primary and fallback scenarios written.
- Invalidation defined before entry.
