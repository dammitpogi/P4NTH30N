## Teaching Themes Detected

- `Macro event framing`: CPI, NFP, retail sales, geopolitical/oil risk.
- `Volatility regime`: VIX-related transitions, OpEx effects, momentum/range behavior.
- `Weekly-to-intraday continuity`: weekly thesis carried into daily intraday updates.
- `Options structure teaching`: long iron fly spread and directional/range expectations.

## Utilization Mapping (Nate)

- `Morning prep`: ingest latest weekly post title + intraday title into checklist context.
- `Execution map`: map macro event tags (CPI/NFP/PCE/OpEx) to expected volatility state.
- `Parser tie-in`: preserve level strings from Alma notes and convert SPX->SPY with live ratio.

## Gaps

- RSS captures public post metadata/content only; paid chat/Q&A continuity is incomplete.
- Authenticated scraping path currently blocked by interactive verification flow in headless session.

## Recommended Immediate Follow-Up

1. Run interactive auth scraper path for paid/chat continuity capture.
2. Build teaching-only relevance filter to exclude off-topic chatter.
3. Store normalized daily digest in `workspace/memory/trading.md` schema buckets.
