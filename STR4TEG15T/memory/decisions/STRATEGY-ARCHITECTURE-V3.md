# P4NTHE0N: Streamlined Agentic Architecture v3.0
## Self-Funded Agentic Environment | Multi-Platform Fixer Strategy

**Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Status**: Operational Optimization  
**Environment**: OpenCode + WindSurf Hybrid  
**Philosophy**: In-house implementations, self-funded, agentic automation

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State
- **OpenCode**: Primary agent orchestration, all agents implemented in `C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents`
- **WindSurf**: Fixer execution environment (cheaper per-prompt billing vs context-based)
- **Decision Framework**: Central cost-saving mechanism
- **Model Preference**: Opus 4.6 Thinking (Nexus Preferred)
- **Bug Handling**: Forgewright with unit testing accountability

### Key Optimizations
1. ✅ **Dual Fixer Strategy**: OpenCode Fixer (orchestrated) vs WindSurf Fixer (bulk execution)
2. ✅ **Decision-Driven**: All work flows through Decision framework for cost efficiency
3. ✅ **Multi-Platform**: Leverage WindSurf's Opus 4.6 + cheaper billing
4. ✅ **Self-Funding**: In-house implementations = zero operational costs
5. ✅ **Agentic Workflows**: Automated improvements to roles and automation

## Multi-Platform Strategy

### OpenCode Environment
**Location**: `C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents`
**Purpose**: Agent orchestration, decision management
**Agents**: All 8 implemented
**Billing**: Context-based (more expensive for large contexts)

**Usage Pattern**:
```
Orchestrator (Pyxis)
    ↓
Delegates to specialists
    ↓
One-time changes via OpenFixer
    ↓
Decisions created and tracked
```

### WindSurf Environment
**Location**: P4NTHE0N project workspace
**Purpose**: Bulk Fixer execution, Opus 4.6 access
**Agent**: WindFixer (Opus 4.6 Thinking preferred)
**Billing**: Per-prompt (cheaper for bulk work)

**Usage Pattern**:
```
Strategist creates Decisions
    ↓
Bulk Decisions sent to WindSurf
    ↓
WindFixer executes with Opus 4.6
    ↓
Results synced back to OpenCode
```

### Cost Optimization

| Scenario | OpenCode | WindSurf | Savings |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 100 small decisions | $50 (context) | $20 (per-prompt) | 60% |
| 10 large refactors | $80 (context) | $35 (per-prompt) | 56% |
| Bulk bug fixes | $40 (context) | $15 (per-prompt) | 63% |

**Decision**: Use WindSurf for bulk Decision execution, OpenCode for orchestration

---

## Model Strategy

### Nexus Preferred: Opus 4.6 Thinking

**Query for Oracle/Designer**:
"Do you also recommend Opus 4.6 Thinking as the preferred model for your analysis? What are the trade-offs vs other models (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)?"

**Expected Benefits**:
- Better reasoning for complex architectural decisions
- Thinking mode provides transparency
- Strong performance on code analysis
- Available on WindSurf (bulk execution advantage)

### Model Fallback Issues (Current Problem)

**Status**: Explorer and Librarian buggy due to model fallback failures
**Attempted Fix**: OpenCode Plugin in `C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\dev`
**Skill Available**: `update-agent-models` skill
**Root Cause**: OpenCode fallbacks not working, subagent use difficult

**Workaround Strategy**:
1. Disable Explorer/Librarian subagent delegation for now
2. Use direct tool execution (glob, grep, read) instead
3. Manual research when needed
4. Await OpenCode fallback fix

---

## Agentic Workflow Optimization

### Decision-Centric Workflow

**Current Flow**:
```
User Request
    ↓
Strategist creates Decisions
    ↓
Oracle validates (approval %)
    ↓
Designer plans implementation
    ↓
Decisions sent to WindSurf
    ↓
WindFixer executes (Opus 4.6)
    ↓
Results + new Decisions
    ↓
Strategist hardens roles
```

**Optimized Flow**:
```
User Request
    ↓
Strategist analyzes with Oracle + Designer
    ↓
Parallel: Risk assessment + Implementation plan
    ↓
Strategist creates comprehensive Decisions
    ↓
Bulk batch sent to WindSurf
    ↓
WindFixer executes with Opus 4.6 Thinking
    ↓
Unit tests validate (Forgewright)
    ↓
New patterns → Agent role improvements
    ↓
Decisions for automation enhancement
```

### Automation Improvement Loop

**Self-Improving Agents**:
```
Execution Phase
    ↓
Bugs Found
    ↓
Forgewright triages via T00L5ET
    ↓
Fix applied + unit tests
    ↓
Pattern identified
    ↓
Strategist creates Decision
    ↓
Agent role definition updated
    ↓
Automation workflow enhanced
    ↓
Future executions improved
```

"Do you recommend Opus 4.6 Thinking as preferred model? What are trade-offs?"

**Decision**: STRATEGY-004 Model Strategy Validation

---

## Explorer/Librarian Mitigation

### Current Issue
- Model fallback failures in OpenCode
- Subagent delegation unreliable
- Both agents currently buggy

### Mitigation Strategy

**Short-term**:
1. Disable Explorer/Librarian subagent delegation
2. Use direct tool execution (glob, grep, read)
3. Manual research when needed
4. Document workarounds

**Long-term**:
1. Await OpenCode fallback fix
2. Test with update-agent-models skill
3. Validate in dev environment
4. Re-enable when stable

**Decision**: STRATEGY-005 Explorer/Librarian Mitigation

## Cost Tracking

### Self-Funding Metrics

| Metric | Target | Tracking |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Decision Execution Cost | <$0.50/decision | WindSurf billing |
| Agent Role Improvement | 1/week | Decision count |
| Automation Enhancement | 2/month | Workflow changes |
| Bug Fix Cost | <$5/bug | Forgewright time |
| Total Monthly Cost | <$200 | All platforms |

### Savings Calculation

**Without Decision Framework**:
- OpenCode only: ~$500/month (context billing)

**With Decision Framework + WindSurf**:
- OpenCode (orchestration): ~$50/month
- WindSurf (bulk execution): ~$100/month
- **Total**: ~$150/month
- **Savings**: 70%
