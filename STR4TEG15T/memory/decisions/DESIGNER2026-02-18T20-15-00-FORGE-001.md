# Designer Consultation Request: FORGE-001

**Decision**: FORGE-001 Directory Architecture Standardization  
**Date**: 2026-02-18 20:15:00  
**Requested By**: Strategist  
**Consultation Type**: Implementation Planning & Architecture Design

---

## Decision Summary

FORGE-001 proposes a complete standardization of the T4CT1CS Strategist platform directory architecture. The current organic structure has files scattered across multiple locations with inconsistent naming patterns.

**Core Proposal**:
- Hierarchical directory structure with strict content-type separation
- Standardized naming conventions (enforced by convention, not code)
- Clear read/write permissions per directory for subagents
- Automated indexing via `.index/` directory
- Validation gates for file placement

**Key Structural Changes**:
1. `.index/` - Auto-generated master registries (read-only for subagents)
2. `decisions/` - Split into `_templates/`, `_archive/`, `active/`, `clusters/`
3. `actions/` - Workflow states: `ready/` → `in-progress/` → `done/`
4. `consultations/` - Separate directories for Oracle and Designer
5. `intelligence/` - Categorized: gaps/, risks/, opportunities/, patterns/
6. `context/` - Shared briefs, sessions, references

---

## Questions for Designer

### 1. Implementation Feasibility

**Q1.1**: Is the proposed directory depth (max 3 levels) appropriate, or will it become unwieldy?

**Q1.2**: Should we implement automated index generation, or is manual maintenance acceptable for now?

**Q1.3**: The permission matrix is complex. Should we simplify (e.g., Strategist writes everything, others read everything)?

### 2. Subagent Experience

**Q2.1**: Will the new structure be intuitive for Fixer agents (OpenFixer/WindFixer)? They need to find work quickly.

**Q2.2**: The naming conventions are strict (dashes not underscores, specific formats). Will this cause friction?

**Q2.3**: Should we create a CLI tool or script to help agents create properly-named files?

### 3. Migration Strategy

**Q3.1**: The 48-hour migration window - is this realistic? Should we phase it (e.g., decisions first, then actions, then speech)?

**Q3.2**: Should we use symlinks during transition or just accept a "big bang" cutover?

**Q3.3**: What's the rollback plan if the new structure doesn't work?

### 4. Technical Implementation

**Q4.1**: The `.index/` JSON files need schemas. Should we use JSON Schema validation?

**Q4.2**: Should we implement automated validation (git hooks, CI checks) or rely on convention?

**Q4.3**: The templates use Markdown with headers. Should we consider a more structured format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body)?

### 5. WindSurf Integration

**Q5.1**: WindFixer will execute bulk Decisions in WindSurf. Will this directory structure translate well to that environment?

**Q5.2**: Should we create a WindSurf-specific configuration or brief?

## Current State Context

**Files to Migrate** (detailed):

### Decisions (8 files)
- `STRATEGY-ARCHITECTURE-v3.md` → `_archive/2026-02/STRATEGY-ARCH-v3.md`
- `FOUREYES_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md` → `FOUREYES-000-Decision-Framework.md`
- `FOUREYES_CODEBASE_REFERENCE.md` → `_archive/FOUREYES-REF-v1.md`
- `Idempotent Signal Generation System.md` → `CORE-002-Idempotent-Signals.md`
- `DECISION_ASSIMILATION_REPORT.md` → `_archive/ASSIMILATION-REPORT-001.md`
- + 3 more

### Actions (10 files)
- `WINDFIXER_COMPREHENSIVE_PROMPT.md` → `ready/ACT-043-WindFixer-ARCH-003.md`
- `WINDFIXER_PROMPT.md` → `ready/ACT-044-WindFixer-Prompt.md`
- + 8 more

### Speech (50+ files)
- Convert `20260218_...` → `2026-02-18T...`
- Convert underscores to dashes

## Specific Design Concerns

### Concern 1: Template Complexity
The DECISION-TEMPLATE.md is comprehensive but lengthy. Will Strategist agents use it, or will they copy-paste and edit?

### Concern 2: Index Maintenance Overhead
Maintaining `.index/decisions.json` manually adds overhead. Is the benefit (cross-referencing) worth the cost?

### Concern 3: Nested Directories
`intelligence/gaps/`, `intelligence/risks/`, etc. Is this too granular? Should we flatten to `intelligence/gaps.md` with sections?

### Concern 4: File Count
With 55+ decisions, 76+ actions, 50+ speeches, the flat directories will have many files. Is pagination/search needed?

## Designer Response

### Approval: 74%

### Key Findings
- Directory depth of 3 levels is appropriate; it creates clear separation without excessive nesting.
- The permission matrix is sound but overly complex for initial rollout; simplify first, add granularity later.
- Migration should be phased over 5-7 days, not 48 hours, to minimize disruption.
- Fixer agents need a simple "where is my work" script to reduce onboarding friction.
- WindSurf integration requires a minimal viable structure; full architecture can be synced later.

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)**
1. Create `.index/` directory with initial JSON files
2. Create `decisions/_templates/` and `actions/_templates/`
3. Do NOT move any existing files yet
4. New files ONLY use new structure

**Phase 2: Parallel Operation (Days 2-4)**
1. Keep old paths functional
2. Copy (don't move) decisions to new structure
3. Update `.index/` to track both old and new locations
4. Test Fixer workflows with new paths

**Phase 3: Migration (Day 5)**
1. Move actions from `pending/` to `ready/`
2. Normalize speech filenames (only if automated)
3. Update all cross-references
4. Archive old locations

**Phase 4: Cleanup (Day 6-7)**
1. Remove old path compatibility
2. Enable hard validation
3. Brief all agents on new structure

### Tool Recommendations

**Immediate (Day 1)**:
```powershell
# T4CT1CS/tools/find-work.ps1
# Helps Fixer agents find their next action
Get-ChildItem actions/ready/*.md | Select-Object -First 1
```

**Short-term (Week 1)**:
```powershell
# T4CT1CS/tools/validate-structure.ps1
# Validates file placement and naming
```

**Optional (Week 2)**:
- Git pre-commit hook for naming validation
- Auto-index generator (scan directories, update JSON)

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Flatten intelligence/**: Instead of `intelligence/gaps/`, `intelligence/risks/`, etc., use `intelligence/gaps.md`, `intelligence/risks.md` with sections. Reduces directory sprawl.

2. **Simplify permissions v1**: For initial rollout, use:
   - Strategist: Write everything
   - All other agents: Read decisions, Write to their specific directories
   - Fixer: Move actions between ready/in-progress/done

3. **Index automation**: Instead of manual maintenance, generate indices from directory scans:
   ```json
   // Auto-generated from file system
   {
     "generatedAt": "2026-02-18T20:15:00Z",
     "decisions": [ /* scanned from decisions/active/ */ ]
   }
   ```

4. **WindSurf minimal structure**: WindFixer only needs:
   - `decisions/active/` (read)
   - `actions/ready/` (read)
   - `actions/in-progress/` (write)
   - `actions/done/` (write)
   - Skip `.index/` for WindSurf initially

### Simplifications

1. **Remove `consultations/sessions/`**: Consolidate into `consultations/oracle/` and `consultations/designer/`

2. **Remove `context/references/`**: Move to `decisions/_templates/`

3. **Simplify speech naming**: Allow both `2026-02-18T20-15-00.md` and `2026-02-18T20-15-00-topic.md` - don't enforce topic requirement

4. **Delay validation**: Implement hard validation in Week 2, not Day 1

5. **Index is read-only suggestion**: Agents can write to `.index/` if needed during transition; enforce read-only later

### WindSurf Brief

**For WindFixer execution**:

**Critical Paths**:
```
READ:
  - decisions/active/*.md (understand context)
  - actions/ready/*.md (find work)
  - context/briefs/*.md (implementation guidance)

WRITE:
  - actions/in-progress/*.md (when starting)
  - actions/done/*.md (when complete)
  - system/logs/*.log (execution logs)
```

**Naming Convention for WindFixer**:
- Actions MUST use format: `ACT-[NNN]-[Short-Name].md`
- When moving files: Copy content, create new file, delete old (don't rename in place)

**WindSurf-Specific Guidance**:
1. Ignore `.index/` directory (Strategist manages this)
2. Focus on `actions/` directory - this is your work queue
3. When completing work, always move to `actions/done/`
4. Use `context/briefs/` for detailed implementation guidance

**Cost Optimization**:
- Batch 5-10 related actions per WindSurf session
- Don't read `.index/` files (extra tokens)
- Focus on `ready/` → `done/` workflow

### Blockers (None)

No blockers, but recommend:
- Start with simplified structure (Phase 1 above)
- Add complexity incrementally
- Validate with one Fixer workflow before full rollout

### Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk**: Medium
- **Primary Risk**: Over-engineering initial implementation
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on usage patterns
