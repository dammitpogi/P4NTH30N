# Oracle Consultation Request: FORGE-001

**Decision**: FORGE-001 Directory Architecture Standardization  
**Date**: 2026-02-18 20:15:00  
**Requested By**: Strategist  
**Consultation Type**: Risk Assessment & Architecture Validation

---

## Decision Summary

FORGE-001 proposes a complete standardization of the T4CT1CS Strategist platform directory architecture. The current organic structure has files scattered across multiple locations with inconsistent naming patterns.

**Core Proposal**:
- Hierarchical directory structure with strict content-type separation
- Standardized naming conventions (enforced by convention, not code)
- Clear read/write permissions per directory for subagents
- Automated indexing via `.index/` directory
- Validation gates for file placement

**Key Structural Changes**:
1. `.index/` - Auto-generated master registries (read-only for subagents)
2. `decisions/` - Split into `_templates/`, `_archive/`, `active/`, `clusters/`
3. `actions/` - Workflow states: `ready/` → `in-progress/` → `done/`
4. `consultations/` - Separate directories for Oracle and Designer
5. `intelligence/` - Categorized: gaps/, risks/, opportunities/, patterns/
6. `context/` - Shared briefs, sessions, references

## Questions for Oracle

### 1. Risk Assessment (Critical)

**Q1.1**: What are the primary risks of this directory restructure during active development?

**Q1.2**: The migration plan suggests a 48-hour transition window with symlinks. Is this aggressive timeline feasible, or should we extend it?

**Q1.3**: What happens if a subagent writes to the wrong location during migration? Should we implement hard validation or soft guidance?

### 2. Architecture Validation

**Q2.1**: The permission matrix grants Strategist write access to everything while restricting other agents. Does this create a single point of failure or bottleneck?

**Q2.2**: The `.index/` directory is the source of truth for cross-references. If it becomes corrupted or out of sync, what's the recovery mechanism?

**Q2.3**: Should we implement automated validation (CI/CD style) or rely on convention compliance?

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

**Q3.1**: If an agent cannot find expected files in new locations, what's the fallback strategy?

**Q3.2**: During migration, should both old and new paths be valid, or should we enforce immediate cutover?

### 4. Operational Concerns

**Q4.1**: The speech/ directory uses ISO8601 with dashes. Existing files use underscores. Is migration worth the effort, or should we accept inconsistency?

**Q4.2**: What's the risk of "decision fatigue" - having too many Decisions about the Decision framework itself?

---

## Current State Context

**Files to Migrate** (high-level):
- 8+ decisions in `decisions/active/` with mixed naming
- 10+ actions in `actions/pending/` (to be renamed `ready/`)
- 50+ speech files with inconsistent naming
- Various root-level directories (`audit/`, `intel/`) to consolidate

**Active Work**:
- INFRA-009 through INFRA-010 (infrastructure decisions)
- CORE-001 (core architecture)
- FEAT-001 (LLM inference)
- FOUREYES-001 through FOUREYES-020 (vision system)
- WIN-001 through WIN-008 (win phase)

---

## Specific Concerns

### Concern 1: Index Maintenance
The `.index/` JSON files must be manually maintained (or we build automation). Risk of human error in updating cross-references.

### Concern 2: Subagent Confusion
Four different agents (Oracle, Designer, Fixer, Forgewright) with different read/write permissions. Learning curve may cause mistakes.

### Concern 3: Decision Overhead
Is standardizing the Decision framework itself creating too much meta-work?

### Concern 4: WindSurf Integration
Will this structure work for both OpenCode and WindSurf environments? WindFixer needs clear paths.

## Requested Output

Please provide:

1. **Approval Percentage**: [0-100]% with justification
2. **Blockers**: Any issues that must be resolved before implementation
3. **Recommendations**: Specific changes to the proposed architecture
4. **Risk Rating**: [Low/Medium/High] for overall approach
5. **Timeline Approval**: Is 48-hour migration window acceptable?

## Oracle Response

*[Oracle to fill in below]*

### Approval: 68%

### Key Findings
- Primary risk is reference breakage during active work: open Decisions/Actions linked in other docs or external tooling will 404 unless a stable alias layer exists.
- The 48-hour window is feasible only if the migration is largely automated and the validation gates are not enforced as hard failures during the cutover window.
- The permission matrix centralizes critical write paths in Strategist; this reduces accidental writes but introduces a coordination bottleneck for index updates and action lifecycle transitions.
- The .index directory becomes a single source of truth and single point of failure; without an automated rebuild path, corruption or drift will cascade into navigation failures.
- Naming normalization is valuable for long-term search and automation but is a high-churn change; back-compat mapping is required to avoid losing traceability.

### Blockers (if any)
- No documented automated rebuild or checksum strategy for .index; without this, recovery from corruption is manual and high risk.
- No defined source-of-truth for ID sequencing during migration; concurrent edits could produce duplicate IDs in actions or decisions.
- Validation gates are specified but not staged; enforcing hard checks immediately will stall active work during the move.

### Recommendations
- Implement a deterministic rebuild command for .index (scan directories, regenerate JSON, verify referential integrity) and document it as the fallback path.
- Use a two-stage validation approach: warning-only during migration, hard fail post-cutover.
- Establish a temporary path alias registry (e.g., .index/redirects.json or a mapping table) to resolve old paths and prevent broken links.
- Lock ID allocation during the migration window (single allocator or simple check-in procedure) to avoid duplicates.
- Keep both old and new paths valid for at least one sprint; remove old paths only after index rebuild confirms zero references.
- For speech naming, normalize only new files; batch-rename legacy files only if a redirect map is in place.

### Risk Assessment
- Overall risk rating: Medium
- Primary risks: broken references, partial migration drift, index corruption, and coordination bottlenecks for Strategist-owned writes.
- Timeline approval: 48 hours is aggressive but possible if automation and soft validation are in place; otherwise extend to 5-7 days with staged cutover.
