# DECISION_135: Strategist Synthesis Provocation and Journal Hardening

**Decision ID**: DECISION_135  
**Category**: FORGE  
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: High  
**Date**: 2026-02-25

## Context

Nexus requested strategist synthesis expansion so captured creative detail is fully utilized, with provocative synthesis and stronger journals.

## Decision

1. Upgrade strategist synthesis policy with explicit narrative extraction and quality gates.
2. Add canonical decision-engine synthesis protocol for repeatable, auditable output quality.

## Implementation

- Updated source-of-truth strategist policy:
  - `C:/Users/paulc/.config/opencode/agents/strategist.md`
  - Added:
    - `Synthesis Beast Mode (Provocative Narrative Contract)`
    - `Journal Quality Gate`
    - `Speech Quality Gate`
    - `Synthesis Audit Gate`
- Added canonical synthesis protocol:
  - `STR4TEG15T/memory/decision-engine/SYNTHESIS_PROVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- Registered protocol in decision-engine domain:
  - `STR4TEG15T/memory/decision-engine/README.md`

## Validation Evidence

- Strategist policy includes manifest-driven narrative extraction fields (`tone`, `theme`, `keyMoment`, `emotion`, metrics).
- Strategist policy includes fidelity floor and synthesis audit checks before synthesis completion.
- Decision-engine README references the new synthesis protocol artifact.

## Decision Parity Matrix

- Synthesis feature expanded for stronger creative utilization: **PASS**
- Journal quality expectations hardened: **PASS**
- Provocative speech quality gate codified: **PASS**
- Auditable synthesis closure checks codified: **PASS**

## Execution Notes (Source-Check Order)

1. Decisions first: `DECISION_114`, `DECISION_115`, `DECISION_116`, `DECISION_125`, `DECISION_134`.
2. Knowledge/patterns second:
   - `OP3NF1XER/knowledge/QUICK_QUERY_INDEX.md`
   - `OP3NF1XER/patterns/SOURCE_CHECK_ORDER.md`
3. Local discovery third:
   - current strategist synthesis policy,
   - manifest narrative fields,
   - journal inventory in `STR4TEG15T/memory/journal/`.
4. Post-implementation write-back completed in decision-engine, OP3NF1XER knowledge, and OP3NF1XER patterns.

## Closure Recommendation

`Close` - synthesis and journal workflows are expanded, provocative by contract, and auditable.
