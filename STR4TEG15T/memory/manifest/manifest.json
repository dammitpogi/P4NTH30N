The workflow used hardcoded coordinates causing unwanted clicks on the right side (ANNOUNCE_CLOSE x3, SHARE_CLOSE at rx~0.9) instead of executing user's 20 recorded steps. Solution: Added --use-config flag to run.ts, implemented loadStepConfig() and executeStepsFromConfig() in firekirin-workflow.ts, maintains backward compatibility.
