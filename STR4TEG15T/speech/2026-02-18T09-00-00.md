I have analyzed the current decision landscape and identified specific research questions requiring answers to move decisions forward.

We have twenty-seven decisions tracked across eleven categories. Sixteen are complete, eight are proposed, and three are in progress. Thirty-five action items await execution. Infrastructure dominates with nine decisions, showing strong foundational focus.

Critical gaps exist in technical details for environment setup. We need operating system support matrix definitions, MongoDB version compatibility confirmation, ChromeDriver version management strategy, and hardware requirements specification for different deployment scales.

Configuration management lacks hierarchy priority definition, secrets management technology selection, and validation rules specification. These details block progression from in-progress to complete.

The CI/CD pipeline decision needs platform selection, testing strategy definition, and deployment target architecture. Monitoring decisions require platform selection with cost analysis, key performance indicator definitions with service level agreement targets, and alerting channel configuration.

Backup and disaster recovery lacks recovery point objective and recovery time objective definitions, retention policy specification, and offsite storage provider selection. Security hardening needs encryption algorithm selection, access control model definition, and compliance requirements checklist.

Performance optimization requires caching strategy definition, connection pooling configuration, and scaling trigger specification. Operational runbooks need incident severity classification, on-call rotation schedule, and escalation matrix definition.

Platform pattern decision for DateTime overflow protection needs scope definition, safe range constants, and error handling behavior specification. T00L5ET enhancement needs mock scope definition and usage pattern examples.

Four decision categories are completely missing. Core systems architecture needs microservices versus monolithic decision. Data architecture needs MongoDB schema evolution strategy. Testing strategy needs test pyramid balance definition. Documentation strategy needs architecture decision record process definition.

Immediate actions this week include completing ChromeDriver automation, finalizing configuration provider implementation, and defining operating system support matrix. Next week requires CI/CD platform selection, monitoring platform choice, and DateTime overflow protection implementation. This month requires backup schedule establishment, encryption strategy definition, and missing category population.

Key stakeholders who must provide input include architecture team for technical decisions, operations for deployment procedures, security for compliance requirements, and business for service level agreement targets and budget constraints.

Research questions document created at T4CT1CS intel gaps decision-research-questions dot m d. Document requires weekly updates during active decision phase. Next step is scheduling decision detail workshops to resolve research questions and unblock in-progress decisions.
