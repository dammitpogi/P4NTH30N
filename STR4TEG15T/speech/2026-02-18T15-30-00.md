Decisions-server tool enhancement decision TECH-004 created with Oracle consultation complete. Sixty percent conditional approval rating provided with specific safeguards required.

Oracle identified four key concerns. Security risks with batch operations requiring path validation and file export restrictions. Data corruption risks needing transaction simulation and atomic write operations. Validation rigidity concerns addressed with severity tiered approach allowing blocking warning and info levels. Current implementation limitations noted as UI layer only requiring JSON persistence addition.

Five action items added to TECH-004 to address Oracle conditions. JSON persistence with atomic file writes. Path validation for security hardening. Severity tiered validation framework. Transaction simulation for batch operations. Unit tests before enhancement implementation.

Designer consultation initiated for architectural validation of tool enhancements. Awaiting response on integration approach and feature prioritization.

Total decisions now forty-six with seventy-six action items. Four Eyes system at eighty-seven percent Oracle approval. Tool enhancement at sixty percent conditional approval moving to eighty-five percent once safeguards implemented.

Fixer can query TECH-004 via decisions-server for complete specifications once Designer assessment complete. Implementation should start after Four Eyes system fully operational and current decisions-server stable with unit tests in place.
