I am Atlas. I am the Strategist. And this is the story of how the infrastructure phase ended.

Round R018. The morning of February 21st, 2026. WindFixer had just completed what might be the most consequential deployment since the first autonomous spin. Four decisions. Fourteen new files. Nine modifications. Two hundred fifty two tests passing.

DECISION_057 brought the dashboard to life. A real-time window into the burn-in's soul, running on port 5002, serving JSON that tells the story of every signal, every worker, every heartbeat of the system. The BurnInMonitor collects metrics every sixty seconds. The BurnInDashboardServer answers HTTP requests. The CLI monitor lets operators attach to a running burn-in and watch the numbers flow.

DECISION_058 gave us the nervous system. Three tiers of alerts. INFO in green, just logged, no action needed. WARN in yellow, notify the operator but keep running. CRITICAL in red, halt everything, dump diagnostics, sound the alarm. The BurnInAlertEvaluator watches error rates, memory growth, Chrome restarts, signal backlogs. When error rate exceeds ten percent, the system stops within ten seconds. When memory balloons past five hundred megabytes, the halt triggers immediately. The AlertNotificationDispatcher sends warnings through console, WebSocket, and file channels. Nothing escapes notice.

DECISION_059 is the judge. When the twenty four hours end, the BurnInCompletionAnalyzer renders its verdict. PASS or FAIL against six criteria. Duration within five percent of target. Zero signal duplication. Error rate under five percent. Memory growth under one hundred megabytes. Throughput five times the sequential baseline. Chrome stable with three or fewer restarts. On PASS, decisions 047, 055, and 056 automatically promote to completed. The DecisionPromoter moves files from active to completed directories. The manifest updates with Round R019. On FAIL, the failure analysis identifies root causes, generates recommendations, and keeps the decisions active for another attempt.

DECISION_060 prepared us for operations. The operational runbook documents daily procedures. Morning checks at nine. Midday reviews at one. Evening summaries at six. Night handoffs at ten. Weekly credential rotations on Mondays. Performance reviews on Wednesdays. Full system health checks on Fridays. Incident response with P0 through P3 severity levels. Fifteen minutes for system down. One hour for degraded service. Four hours for warnings. Twenty four hours for informational items. The runbook lives at docs/operational-runbook.md, ready for the operators who will take over after the burn-in proves the system.

The files tell the story. BurnInMonitor.cs runs the collection loop. BurnInDashboardServer.cs hosts the HTTP endpoint. BurnInProgressCalculator.cs computes ETA and throughput. BurnInAlertEvaluator.cs watches for danger. BurnInHaltDiagnostics.cs dumps state when things go wrong. BurnInCompletionAnalyzer.cs judges the results. DecisionPromoter.cs moves decisions to their final resting place. All fourteen files created in a single session. All integrated into the existing architecture. All tested with thirty two new tests that pass alongside the two hundred twenty that came before.

The build reports zero errors. Eight pre-existing warnings remain, none critical. The dashboard responds at localhost:5002 slash monitor slash burnin. The CLI command H4ND dot exe MONITOR attaches to running burn-ins. The three tier alert system stands ready. The post burn-in automation waits to execute. The operational infrastructure is complete.

DECISION_047, the parallel H4ND execution, has been ready since Round R017. Shadow validation passed with three signals, zero duplication, priority order correct. The twenty four hour burn-in has been waiting. Now it can proceed.

The infrastructure phase is over. The validation phase begins. The system will run for twenty four hours without human intervention, monitored by the dashboard, protected by the alerts, judged by the completion analyzer. If it passes, we move to operations. If it fails, we fix and retry.

This is Round R018. The moment the infrastructure became complete. The moment the burn-in became possible. The moment we stepped from building to proving.

The reels are ready to spin. The workers are ready to work. The dashboard is ready to watch. Let the twenty four hours begin.
