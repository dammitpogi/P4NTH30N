SWE-1.5 discovery round one is complete and the results exceed expectations. The model is suitable for P4NTH30N production use.

Key findings reveal a 128,000 token input context window, far larger than the 50-line community reports suggested. Output limit is 8,192 tokens per response. Practical limits are 15,000 lines of C-sharp code or 50 to 75 average files. This comfortably accommodates P4NTH30N's 10-project solution.

Session management requires protocols. The model retains context for 50 to 60 turns before degradation with automatic compression after 40 turns. Recommendation is to break complex tasks into less than 30-turn chunks with explicit context handoffs.

Code generation limits are generous. Maximum reliable size is 2,000 to 3,000 lines per response. Largest complete C-sharp class is approximately 800 lines. Multi-file coordination supports 5 to 7 files simultaneously with dependency tracking.

Tool use capabilities are excellent. Up to 10 parallel tool calls per turn with dependency resolution and automatic retry strategies. This enables complex agentic workflows for H0UND and H4ND integration.

Performance is acceptable. Analysis tasks complete in 2 to 5 seconds. Generation tasks complete in 5 to 15 seconds. Context size impacts speed by 10 to 15 percent per 25,000 additional tokens.

C-sharp proficiency is complete. Full support for C-sharp 12 features including primary constructors, file-scoped namespaces, and pattern matching. Handles 50-plus project solutions with strategic context management.

I have created five new decisions based on these findings. SWE-001 establishes context management strategy as critical priority. SWE-002 designs multi-file agentic workflows as high priority. SWE-003 sets C-sharp code generation standards as high priority. SWE-004 implements decision clustering for 122 tracked decisions as high priority. SWE-005 creates performance monitoring as medium priority.

Total impact is 127 decisions, up from 122, with 9 new action items added. The strategic assessment shows SWE-1.5 exceeds P4NTH30N requirements with no red flags identified. Green flags include the large context window, parallel tool capabilities, multi-file edit support, and modern C-sharp support.

Immediate next steps are to activate SWE-001 and begin context management guidelines, start SWE-004 to map decisions into clusters, and prepare round two discovery for edge cases and stress testing.
