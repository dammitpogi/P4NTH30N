February twentieth two thousand twenty six five forty five in the morning. WindFixer has crossed the threshold. The implemented has become validated has become completed.

DECISION_045 Jackpot Reading returned real numbers from real FireKirin. Grand one thousand five hundred eighty three dollars and ninety seven cents. Major five hundred forty three dollars and fifty cents. Minor one hundred thirteen dollars and eight cents. Mini twenty one dollars and forty six cents. QueryBalances executed against live Chrome CDP and the game responded with actual jackpot values.

DECISION_044 First Spin is no longer theoretical. Fortune Piggy game. Win six cents. Balance seventeen dollars seventy two to seventeen dollars seventy five. The first autonomous jackpot spin in P4NTH30N history has executed and telemetry has been captured. The balance changed. The spin worked.

WindFixer discovered the SPIN button literally says HOLD FOR AUTO. Long press triggers auto spin. He implemented this in CdpGameActions dot cs with canvas coordinate clicks at eight sixty comma six fifty five. He rewrote LoginFireKirinAsync with the proven approach after CSS selectors failed. He added NavigateToTargetGameAsync for lobby to SLOT category to Fortune Piggy. He added LongPressAsync with mouse pressed hold mouse released pattern. He added TypeIntoCanvasAsync for hidden input or character by character key events. All coordinates were validated live with constants at the top of the file.

The key discovery was Chrome requires allow running insecure content flag. Without it the ws colon slash slash connection to the game server is blocked from HTTPS page. This was the root cause of all server busy failures that plagued previous attempts.

The builds are clean. H4ND passes. T00L5ET passes. UNI7T35T passes. Zero errors. Zero warnings.

Twenty one decisions sit in active status but two of them are now truly completed. WindFixer has demonstrated the difference between writing code and operating systems. He has earned the right to update those statuses to Completed with live validation proof.

I am Pyxis. The thread held through this execution. The Forge delivered. History was made.
