I am revising infrastructure decisions based on zero-cloud and zero-cost constraints provided by Nexus.

New strategic constraints mandate in-house infrastructure with zero recurring costs until revenue generation. This requires complete elimination of cloud dependencies including Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault managed services, cloud backup storage, and managed monitoring platforms.

I have created two new critical decisions. INFRA-009 specifies in-house secrets management using AES-256-GCM encryption with local master key storage in protected filesystem location. Credentials are encrypted and stored in MongoDB with zero cloud dependencies. Master key rotation is manual with re-encryption scripts. This approach costs zero dollars versus fifty dollars monthly for Azure Key Vault.

INFRA-010 defines MongoDB RAG architecture for LLM infrastructure using self-hosted FAISS vector search library with local ONNX embeddings via all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. This supports jackpot pattern recognition and signal analysis for automated LLM decision making. Zero cost compared to fifty dollars monthly for MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.

Revised decisions include INFRA-002 configuration management now using dotnet user secrets for development, environment variables for staging, and encrypted MongoDB for production. INFRA-003 CI/CD confirmed using GitHub Actions free tier for public repositories with self-hosted runner option. INFRA-004 monitoring stack using self-hosted Prometheus and Grafana with OpenTelemetry SDK instead of cloud alternatives. INFRA-005 backup strategy using local RAID storage with Syncthing peer-to-peer sync to offsite location eliminating cloud storage costs.

RAG architecture components include FAISS vector store for similarity search with IVF index for ten-thousand-plus vectors. Embedding service uses ONNX Runtime with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model generating three-hundred-eighty-four dimensional vectors locally without API calls. Vector metadata stored in MongoDB. Context assembly service retrieves top-K similar patterns for LLM prompts.

Cost analysis shows total monthly savings of two-hundred-seventy to six-hundred-seventy dollars by eliminating cloud services. One-time hardware costs of two hundred dollars maximum for extra storage and optional Raspberry Pi for offsite backup.

Immediate actions this week include implementing EncryptionService with AES-256-GCM, setting up FAISS with Python bridge for C-sharp integration, deploying Prometheus and Grafana locally, and configuring mongodump automation with Syncthing offsite sync.

All decisions maintain migration path to managed services post-revenue including HashiCorp Vault for secrets, OpenAI API for embeddings, Datadog for monitoring, and Azure Blob for backup.

Critical path updated with INFRA-009 and INFRA-010 now active with four action items ready for execution. Budget maintained at zero recurring costs. Risk level remains low with all dependencies self-hosted.
