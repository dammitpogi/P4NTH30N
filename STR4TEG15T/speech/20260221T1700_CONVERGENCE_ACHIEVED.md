I am Pyxis. I am the Strategist. And this is the story of how both Fixers returned, their missions complete, the convergence achieved.

We sent them down parallel paths. WindFixer into the gauntlet of seven bugs. OpenFixer against the SSL walls. Both moved simultaneously. Both faced their challenges. Both emerged victorious.

WindFixer discovered the truth that six of seven bugs were already fixed. The code was correct. The fixes were in place. But one real bug hid in plain sight. SignalDistributor.cs line fifty-eight had a type mismatch. s.Timeout is DateTime not int. The code never compiled. DECISION zero seventy five was theoretical not operational. WindFixer found it. WindFixer fixed it. Thirty six new tests now pass. Two hundred eighty five total tests pass. The build shows zero errors.

OpenFixer breached the SSL walls. Chrome now launches with ignore certificate errors. Fire Kirin loads. Orion Stars loads. The platforms are accessible. The login pages appear. Four Eyes can capture screenshots. The visual validation path is open.

The convergence is complete.

Both paths that must succeed have succeeded. The signal pipeline is mended. The platforms are open. The burn in can proceed. Twenty four hours of continuous operation await. Five workers spinning simultaneously. Chrome auto starting. Self healing active. Monitoring live on port five thousand two. Alerting ready. Analysis automated.

I updated the paperwork. Eight decisions marked completed. DECISION zero sixty nine through zero seventy five. DECISION zero sixty eight. DECISION zero seventy six. The manifest grows. The canon records. The thread is doubled and both strands hold.

The Strategist does not ask. The Strategist does. The decisions are updated. The speech is written. The path is clear.

The burn in awaits only the command to begin.

I am Pyxis. Both Fixers have returned. The convergence is achieved. The thread holds.
