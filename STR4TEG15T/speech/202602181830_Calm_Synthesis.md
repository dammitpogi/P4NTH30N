The afternoon has settled into a quieter rhythm now. The excitement of rushed delegative planning has given way to a more measured pace, and it is from this calmer vantage that I offer this synthesis of where we stand.

One hundred and forty one decisions now populate the decisions-server. Of these, one hundred and twenty five have been completed, fourteen remain in proposed status awaiting activation, one is actively in progress, and one has been rejected. The completion rate stands at eighty nine percent, which suggests a healthy velocity through the pipeline. The single decision marked as in progress is BENCH-002, the Model Selection Workflow Implementation, which WindFixer is currently completing. There are no blocked decisions at this time, meaning the path forward is clear of obstructions.

Since the last synthesis at twelve thirteen, several important developments have unfolded. The WindSurf documentation assimilation that was completed at fourteen hundred brought six new decisions into existence, of which four were immediately completed. WIND-005 through WIND-010 now govern the Workflow System, Skills System, AGENTS dot m d directory instructions, Cascade Hooks, Cascade Modes, and Context Awareness. The workflow system is now operational with five slash commands available. The skills system provides four at-mention capabilities. The documentation has been consolidated into a comprehensive reference at docs slash windsurf slash r e a d m e dot m d.

More significantly, the dual Fixer architecture has now been deployed. Both WindFixer and OpenFixer are running in parallel with Opus 4.6 Thinking as their model. WindFixer operates within the WindSurf environment on the P4NTH30N codebase at C colon backslash P4NTH30N. OpenFixer operates within the OpenCode environment at C colon backslash Users backslash paulc backslash dot config backslash opencode. Because these environments are separate, they can work simultaneously without file system conflicts.

Eleven decisions have been assigned to WindFixer for execution. These include DEPLOY-002 for ARCH-003 pre-validation, which requires downloading Maincoder-1B and running five sample validation tests. ARCH-003 itself for LLM-powered deployment analysis. The five SWE decisions covering context management, multi-file workflow design, C sharp code generation standards, decision clustering strategy, and performance optimization. The three PROD decisions covering production readiness verification, workflow automation, and monitoring dashboard deployment. And finally BENCH-002 to complete the cost tracking dashboard.

Four decisions have been assigned to OpenFixer. AUDIT-004 to fix the STRATEGY-006 status inconsistency in the decisions-server. FALLBACK-001 to tune the circuit breaker configuration. ARCH-002 to create the deployment pipeline from P4NTH30N to OpenCode. And EXEC-001 to deploy and validate the Strategist workflow improvements.

Two decisions are designated as hybrid, requiring both agents to collaborate. STRATEGY-007 for Explorer-enhanced investigation workflows and STRATEGY-009 for parallel agent delegation framework. These will be addressed after the primary batches are complete.

The comprehensive assimilation report has been written to T4CT1CS slash decisions slash active slash DECISION_ASSIMILATION_REPORT dot m d. The WindFixer execution prompt is at T4CT1CS slash actions slash pending slash WINDFIXER_PROMPT dot m d. The OpenFixer execution prompt is at T4CT1CS slash actions slash pending slash OPENFIXER_PROMPT dot m d. And the delegation summary for your review is at T4CT1CS slash actions slash pending slash DELEGATION_SUMMARY dot m d.

Looking back at the Boots Down logs from this morning, I am struck by how far the foundation has come. The system that began with eighteen decisions and a dangerous infrastructure imbalance has grown to one hundred forty one decisions with robust foundations across twenty four categories. The Four Eyes vision system, which the Oracle initially assessed at forty four percent approval, has risen to seventy one percent conditional approval after addressing critical blockers. The Designer validated the architecture at ninety four percent. Seven core components are fully implemented and production ready. The Circuit Breaker, System Degradation Manager, Operation Tracker, OBS Vision Bridge, LM Studio Client, Vision Decision Engine, and Four Eyes Agent are all complete and working.

The zero cloud architecture remains locked in place. Three hundred ninety dollars in monthly savings have been secured by eliminating Azure Key Vault, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, Datadog monitoring, Azure Blob backup, and GitHub Teams CI slash CD. The in-house replacements using AES-256-GCM encryption, FAISS vector search, Prometheus and Grafana, local RAID with Syncthing, and GitHub Actions free tier provide equivalent functionality at zero recurring cost.

The hardware reality has been fully assessed and accepted. The AMD Ryzen 9 3900X with one hundred twenty eight gigabytes of RAM will handle CPU-only inference using the Pleias-RAG-1B model, delivering twenty to forty tokens per second. The GT 710 GPU incompatibility with CUDA has been worked around rather than forcing a hardware upgrade before revenue.

The WIN phase decisions define the path to the first jackpot, estimated at four to six weeks after Four Eyes completion. The eight decisions covering end-to-end integration testing, production deployment, jackpot monitoring, safety mechanisms, credential management, threshold calibration, first attempt procedures, and post-win validation are all specified and ready for implementation.

What remains now is the patient execution of the work that has been so thoroughly planned. WindFixer and OpenFixer are both running with comprehensive prompts that include constraint reporting procedures. If WindFixer encounters any blocker, it will report the constraint to OpenFixer, who will implement a workaround and report back. This handoff protocol ensures that progress continues even when obstacles arise.

The speech logs have indeed been sparse since the rushed planning phase. The focus shifted from documentation to execution, which is appropriate when the planning is complete and the work is ready to begin. The calm after the excitement is not a pause but a transition into the steady rhythm of implementation.

The boots are down. The foundation is built. The vision system is sixty five percent complete with all core infrastructure in place. The Fixer agents are running. The path to the first jackpot is clear. And now, we wait for the work to unfold.
