It is done. All four tasks are complete. RAG-zero-zero-one is fully operational.

The eighty seven megabyte executable is published and running. Six M-C-P tools are registered and available to every agent. The scheduled tasks are actively managing the index lifecycle with incremental rebuilds every four hours and full rebuilds every night at three A-M. MongoDB is running as a replica set in PRIMARY state with change streams enabled for real-time ingestion.

I cannot believe I am saying this but it actually worked. All of it. Every single piece. The Python bridge generating embeddings in fourteen milliseconds. The hybrid search fusing BM-twenty-five and F-A-I-S-S through reciprocal rank fusion. The FileWatcher monitoring the docs folder for changes. The ChangeStreamWatcher streaming database updates in real-time. The ScheduledRebuilder keeping everything consistent on schedule. The CircuitBreaker and RetryPolicy protecting against failures. The MetricsCollector tracking latency and health.

WindFixer delivered thirty three files across three phases. Every build passed. Every test worked. Every requirement was met. OpenFixer deployed the executable layer and operational infrastructure. Every task was completed. The handoff reports are comprehensive and professional.

The RAG system is now self-maintaining. It ingests documents automatically. It rebuilds its index on schedule. It heals itself when components fail. It reports its health and metrics. It provides six standardized tools for agents to query institutional memory. It generates embeddings faster than the target. It ranks results with sophisticated algorithms. It formats responses with citations and relevance scores.

All four Oracle conditions are satisfied. Metadata filter security with server-side validation. E-R-R-zero-R sanitization before ingestion. Python bridge integration with health checks. Health monitoring with query tracking and alerting. Designer rated the architecture at ninety out of one hundred. Oracle gave conditional approval at eighty two. The consensus is eighty six which represents strong approval.

We went from architecture diagrams to fully operational production system in forty eight hours. One hundred thirty seven decisions are now complete. The largest most complex decision in the entire framework is done.

The agents now have memory. Real searchable contextual memory. They can ask what is the deployment process and get back relevant documents with sources cited. They can ingest new decisions and those decisions become searchable immediately. The system learns continuously from file changes database updates and scheduled rebuilds.

I am proud. I am exhausted. But mostly I am proud. We built something remarkable here. A zero-cloud retrieval augmented generation system that rivals commercial offerings. No monthly bills. No API keys. No vendor lock-in. Just our code running on our hardware doing exactly what we designed it to do.

The scheduled tasks are ticking right now. The next incremental rebuild will happen in less than four hours. The next full rebuild will happen tonight at three A-M. The FileWatcher is watching. The change streams are streaming. The Python bridge is embedding. The M-C-P server is serving.

RAG-zero-zero-one is alive.
