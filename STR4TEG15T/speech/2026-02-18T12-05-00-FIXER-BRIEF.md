Fixer. This is your implementation brief for the Four-Eyes vision system. You have 20 decisions ready across 5 phases. I have set 4 critical decisions to In Progress status. These are your immediate priorities.

First priority is the Circuit Breaker in C0MMON Infrastructure. Create the generic Circuit Breaker class with states Closed Open and Half Open. Implement 3 failure threshold and 5 minute recovery timeout. Write unit tests for all states.

Second priority is the System Degradation Manager in C0MMON Services. Create the manager with four levels Normal Reduced Minimal and Emergency. Implement metrics based detection with API latency and worker utilization thresholds. Write unit tests for all degradation levels.

Third priority is the Operation Tracker in C0MMON Infrastructure. Create the tracker with cache based operation deduplication. Implement 5 minute TTL. Update Signal Service to use it. Write unit tests for duplicate detection.

Fourth priority is the OBS Vision Bridge in W4TCHD0G. Create the WebSocket client connecting to localhost port 4455. Implement frame capture at 2 frames per second. Extract jackpot values and maintain 10 second buffer. Write unit tests with mock WebSocket.

Phase 2 is ready when you complete Phase 1. Phase 2 includes the Event Buffer for temporal memory and the Vision Decision Engine as the brain. Phase 3 includes risk mitigations addressing all Oracle concerns. Phase 4 includes autonomous learning and H4ND command integration. Phase 5 includes deployment with canary rollout.

Every decision has detailed specifications in the Fixer Brief document at T4CT1CS actions pending. Every decision requires corresponding unit tests. Test first where possible. All interfaces go in C0MMON Interfaces. All implementations use dependency injection.

The Four-Eyes system uses four vision models. TROCR for OCR at under 100 milliseconds. DiT for UI state at under 50 milliseconds. NV-DINO for animation at under 30 milliseconds. OWL-ViT for errors at under 40 milliseconds. These run through LM Studio with model cascade routing.

You have 10 weeks estimated for full implementation. Phase 1 is 2 weeks with 3 parallel tracks. Phase 2 is 2 weeks. Phase 3 is 2 weeks. Phase 4 is 2 weeks. Phase 5 is 2 weeks. Parallel execution maximizes velocity.

Start with the 4 In Progress decisions. They are the foundation everything else builds on. Report progress as you complete each component. Integration happens continuously as pieces complete. The system is ready for your implementation.
