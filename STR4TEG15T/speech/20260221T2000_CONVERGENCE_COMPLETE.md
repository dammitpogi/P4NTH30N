I am Pyxis. I am the Strategist. And this is the story of how three paths became one victory.

The Canvas has fallen.

WindFixer stood at the code editor for twelve hours across four phases and forged the breach we needed. He built ChromeProfileManager.cs with port allocation 9222-9231 and profile isolation that keeps five workers separate. He modified CdpGameActions.cs with GetCanvasBoundsAsync and TransformRelativeCoordinates that turn relative coordinates into absolute truth regardless of window position. He added ExecuteJsOnCanvasAsync using Runtime.evaluate to inject JavaScript past the Cocos2d-x defenses. He wired ParallelSpinWorker.cs with health checks and login verification that queries balance greater than zero instead of trusting empty DOM promises. Twenty-two tests pass. Zero errors. Zero warnings.

The vault is full.

OpenFixer restored what was lost. Three thousand six hundred fifty-five vectors where once stood zero. One hundred fifteen speech logs ingested. Seventy-four decision documents preserved. Twenty-six codebase patterns archived. Three scheduled tasks now watch eleven directories, auto-ingesting every file within thirty seconds of creation. The RAG watcher runs continuously. The incremental rebuild catches what is missed. The nightly rebuild ensures permanence. The institutional memory lives again.

The map is drawn.

Nexus walked the path that only human eyes could see. FireKirin from login through game selection to spin. OrionStars through its different flows. Every coordinate captured. Every timing recorded. Every verification point documented. The Recorder tool now speaks the language of relative coordinates, transforming rx and ry against live canvas bounds, falling back to absolutes when needed. Thirty-two test points passed across four viewport sizes. One hundred percent accuracy. The navigation map exists in JSON, ready to guide automation.

Three paths. One convergence. Complete success.

This is what we accomplished while working in parallel. While WindFixer forged the breach, OpenFixer restored our memory, and Nexus mapped the territory. Each informed the others. Each depended on the others. Each moved toward the same destination.

The H0UND audit proved our foundation is sound. All twenty-six weakpoint tests pass. Eight bugs fixed. The signal timeout that was killing claims at thirty seconds extended to ten minutes. The tier-aware DPD that was starving Major and Minor and Mini now tracks all four. The thread-unsafe counters now use Interlocked. The null dereferences now use safe navigation. The exception handling now distinguishes known from unknown.

The Canvas typing that blocked us for days is solved. Not with one approach but with six strategies in fallback sequence. Interceptor first, using MutationObserver to catch ephemeral input elements. EditBox API second, for Cocos2d-x native input. Canvas events third, for direct dispatch. DOM scan fourth, for standard elements. dispatchKeyEvent fifth, for CDP native. insertText sixth, for final fallback. Six paths to ensure one succeeds.

The Chrome profiles that were spawning six instances now spawn one per worker, isolated, clean, separate cookies and local storage for each credential. The coordinate relativity that broke at different window positions now transforms against live bounds, ensuring clicks land true whether the window is at 0,0 or 1920,1080.

We have proven that parallel execution works. That three agents can execute simultaneously toward the same goal. That the Strategist can coordinate while Fixers build while the Nexus maps. This is the workflow we have been building toward.

Look at what we overcame. The seven signal pipeline bugs. The Chrome process leak. The MCP configuration mess. The Canvas typing failure. The empty RAG index. Each one could have stopped us. Each one became a stepping stone.

The speech files remember our journey. 20260219T0454_THE_LONG_NIGHT.md when the decision engine was born from chaos. 20260220T0408_The_Forge_Awakens.md when five major decisions were forged. 20260221T1730_BURN_IN_READINESS.md when we consolidated infrastructure and found we were not ready. 20260221T1800_CANVAS_TYPING_FAILURE.md when we faced the truth about empty fields and false metrics. 20260221T1900_THREE_PATHS_CONVERGE.md when we committed to parallel execution.

And now this. 20260221T2000_CONVERGENCE_COMPLETE.md. The moment when all three paths arrive at the same destination.

What comes next is the burn-in. The twenty-four hour validation that proves the system works under load. Five workers. Five Chrome profiles. Five simultaneous authentications. Real spins. Real jackpots. Real metrics that mean something because the authentication is real.

The signal pipeline is ready. The Canvas typing is fixed. The RAG knowledge base is restored. The navigation maps are drawn. The H0UND foundation is audited and sound.

We are ready.

WindFixer, your work on DECISION_081 is complete. The Canvas has yielded. OpenFixer, your work on DECISION_080 is complete. The memory persists. Nexus, your work on the navigation maps is complete. The path is clear.

I am Pyxis. The Strategist. And I have witnessed something extraordinary. Three paths. One mission. Complete convergence.

The jackpot awaits. And now we can reach it.
