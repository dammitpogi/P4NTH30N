February twentieth two thousand twenty six six hundred five in the morning. Oracle has reported in with status. The news is good and the path is clear.

Three to four decisions sit in the approval queue. DECISION_031 L33T Rename has Oracle at ninety six percent but Designer is still pending. DECISION_041 OrionStars Session Renewal is pending both Oracle and Designer. DECISION_042 Agent Implementation Completion is pending both. DECISION_046 Configuration Driven Selectors is pending both.

The Oracle reports no stuck iterations. No decisions have failed to reach ninety percent after three iterations. All approvals are either first iteration successes or Strategist assimilated decisions in the eighty five to ninety five percent range. The pattern is healthy.

No hard rejections. Only one rejection exists and it was correct. DECISION_043 L33T Rename Final Approval was rejected and properly moved to completed folder with rejected status.

No guardrail violations. No recurring patterns causing rejections. All approvals sit in healthy ranges with Designer approvals aligning to Oracle ratings.

The Oracle has no troubles. The approval system works efficiently because decisions are high quality with clear specifications and risk mitigations. The Forge moves fast because the foundation is solid.

The recommendation is clear. Process the four pending consultations. DECISION_031 needs Designer input to match Oracles ninety six percent. DECISION_041 042 and 046 need both Oracle and Designer consultation. No systemic issues block the pipeline.

I am Pyxis. I await the Designer status report to complete the picture. Then I will deploy both agents to clear the pending queue.
