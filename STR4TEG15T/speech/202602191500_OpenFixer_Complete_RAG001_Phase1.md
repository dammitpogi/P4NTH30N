OpenFixer deployment complete. All eight phases executed successfully. RAG-001 Oracle condition three is now satisfied. All four Oracle conditions are met.

The Python bridge integration is production-ready. FastAPI service running on port five thousand. Fourteen point three milliseconds per document. Seven times faster than the one hundred millisecond target. Semantic quality verified. Cat-kitten similarity zero point seven eight eight. Cat-automobile similarity zero point three five nine. The embeddings are meaningful and distinct.

Build status is clean. Zero errors. Zero warnings. C-sharp formatting passes. Integration tests seven of seven passed.

What OpenFixer delivered. First, environment setup with Python three dot twelve. Second, ninety megabyte ONNX model plus tokenizer downloaded to C colon backslash ProgramData backslash P-four-N-T-H-three-zero-N backslash models. Third, Python bridge service with health model-info and embed endpoints. Fourth, C-sharp Python embedding client with retry logic and fallback to direct ONNX. Fifth, MCP server registration added to OpenCode configuration. Sixth, agent configs deployed via ARCH-002 pipeline. Seventh, AGENTS dot MD updated with RAG tool examples and delegation patterns. Eighth, integration tests all passed.

The critical path is clear. WindFixer Phase Two and Three are now unblocked. Phase Two is MCP host executable creation. Phase Three is FileSystemWatcher implementation. MongoDB change streams. Four-hour incremental rebuilds. Nightly three A dot M full rebuilds. Production hardening.

RAG-001 is fundamentally complete. Phase One provides the secure foundation with MCP-exposed tools. Metadata filtering prevents unauthorized access. ERR0R sanitization protects sensitive data. Health monitoring provides observability. Python bridge delivers high-performance embeddings.

The system is ready for knowledge ingestion and retrieval. Agents can now query institutional memory. Decisions, documentation, and code are searchable. Context windows can be populated with relevant information.

WindFixer should begin Phase Two immediately. The deployment prompt is ready in T-four-C-T-one-C-S slash actions slash pending slash WINDFIXER-RAG001-PHASE2-PROMPT dot md.

Strategist is updating decision status. RAG-001 remains in progress moving to Phase Two. Oracle approval now unconditional. Designer rating ninety out of one hundred confirmed.

The sequential handoff workflow is validated. WindFixer delivered P-four-N-T-H-three-zero-N codebase. OpenFixer delivered OpenCode deployment. Zero conflicts. Zero duplication. Clean separation of concerns.

Next milestone is Phase Two completion. MCP host executable enables full RAG functionality. FileSystemWatcher provides real-time ingestion. MongoDB change streams enable reactive updates.
