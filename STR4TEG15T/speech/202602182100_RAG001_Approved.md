RAG zero zero one has been fully assessed and approved for implementation. Both Designer and Oracle have completed their consultations and the decision is ready to proceed.

Designer rated the MCP exposed RAG architecture at ninety out of one hundred. Oracle provided conditional approval at eighty two out of one hundred. The consensus rating is eighty six out of one hundred which represents strong approval with manageable conditions.

The final architecture decisions are as follows. The primary interface will be an MCP server with six tools. This received a ninety out of one hundred rating from Designer and full approval from Oracle. The embedding service will use ONNX runtime in process with sentence transformers as a fallback. The vector store will use FAISS index flat L two with MongoDB for metadata migrating to IVF at fifty thousand vectors. The ingestion strategy is a hybrid approach using file system watchers MongoDB change streams four hour incremental rebuilds and a nightly full rebuild at three AM.

Context assembly will be structured with sources showing relevance scores and source attribution with a token budget of two thousand. Agent integration will use explicit context builder as the primary pattern with direct MCP calls for common cases. RAG middleware with automatic context injection was explicitly rejected as too risky. Chunking will use five hundred twelve tokens with fifteen percent overlap which Oracle increased from ten percent for better recall. The chunking will be AST aware for code and section aware for documentation.

Security will use metadata filtering by agent ID rather than separate indexes. Oracle imposed several mandatory conditions for this approach including server side filter validation audit logging to the EV three NT collection a query whitelist for filterable fields and a test suite verifying that filter bypass is impossible. Performance targets are approved with Oracle adjusting the embedding target to fifty to seventy five milliseconds and adding a query success rate target of greater than ninety nine point five percent.

Python bridges are acceptable with conditions including a process pool with two to three warm processes auto restart with exponential backoff thirty second timeouts and one gigabyte memory limits per process. Sanitization rules are defined for the ERR zero R collection including replacing file paths with relative paths hashing or removing line numbers stripping stack traces to exception types only rejecting entire documents containing credentials hashing user identifiers with SHA two five six and allowing exception messages but redacting URLs and IPs.

Oracle identified several blocking conditions that must be fixed before implementation. These include implementing metadata filter security with server side validation and audit logging building the ERR zero R sanitization pipeline before ingestion creating the Python bridge integration layer with process pooling and adding health monitoring integration. Additionally Oracle specified items that should be fixed before production including four hour incremental rebuilds accuracy metrics definition and degraded mode for partial results.

Monitoring requirements include tracking query latency with an alert threshold of one hundred fifty milliseconds embedding latency with an alert at one hundred milliseconds index size with an alert at one gigabyte and query success rate with an alert below ninety nine percent. Alerting rules are defined for critical conditions like RAG MCP server down or index corruption and warning conditions like query error rates above one percent or Python process restarts exceeding five per day.

The implementation timeline is fifteen days across three weeks. Phase one builds the MCP server foundation and security layer. Phase two builds the core RAG pipeline and ingestion systems. Phase three focuses on production hardening and monitoring. The risk assessment identifies metadata filter bypass as low likelihood but critical impact mitigated by validation and logging. Python process crashes are medium likelihood and high impact mitigated by process pools and auto restart. Index corruption is low likelihood and critical impact mitigated by backups and atomic swaps.

RAG zero zero one is conditionally approved with a consensus rating of eighty six out of one hundred. Implementation can proceed once the blocking conditions are addressed in phase one.
