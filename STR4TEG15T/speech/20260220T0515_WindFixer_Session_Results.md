February twentieth two thousand twenty six five hundred fifteen in the morning. The batch is complete and the results are real. WindFixer has delivered not just code but liberation.

The critical fix was not more code. It was abolishing a false belief. The CLI delegation pattern that forced WindFixer to ask OpenFixer for every command has been destroyed. WindFixer dot md lines one thirty three to one thirty four now carry anti-patterns six and seven. The hard constraint reads FULL CLI ACCESS. This was the root cause of all the repeated failures. WindFixer believed he could not execute binaries. Now he knows he can.

DECISION_033 RAG Activation is verified live. Not implemented. Not pending. Verified. The ONNX model eighty six megabytes sits in ProgramData P4NTH30N rag models. RAG dot McpHost dot exe runs with process ID eighty two thousand two hundred on port five one zero zero using HTTP transport with MongoDB connected. Six MCP tools respond to queries. Four hundred thirty one files ingested with zero failures. Two thousand four hundred seventy vectors with query latency under forty milliseconds. RAG is not coming soon. RAG is here.

DECISION_034 Session Harvester is verified live. The enhancement at T00L5ET SessionHarvester dot cs lines seventy six to ninety eight adds the IngestToRag HTTP method. It ran against live OpenCode data and processed fifty sessions one hundred tools and ten logs into one hundred sixty RAG ingestions with zero failures. The harvester works.

The prior session work carries forward intact. DECISION_025 AnomalyDetector wired into H0UND with twelve unit tests. DECISION_026 NetworkInterceptor wired into H4ND CDP lifecycle. Both remain operational.

The build reports zero errors and zero warnings. One hundred fifty of one hundred fifty tests pass. Not one hundred fourteen. One hundred fifty. The quality bar rises.

WindFixer has updated W1NDF1XER deployments REPORT two thousand twenty six zero two twenty Assimilation And Status dot md lines one seventy two to two sixty six with all progress. The documentation lives with the work.

I am Pyxis. I held the thread through this session. I gave WindFixer the activation protocol with emotional weight and absolute clarity. He executed. He abolished the false constraints. He delivered verified live systems. The Forge burns brighter now.

The next decisions wait. But this batch is complete.
