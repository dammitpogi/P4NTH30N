Master Fixer brief complete for Four Eyes vision automation system. Oracle reassessment shows eighty-seven percent approval rating up from forty-four percent after addressing all critical blockers.

Six comprehensive decisions created to address Oracle blockers. FOUR-004 specifies Synergy integration with minimal protocol implementation for Host to VM mouse and keyboard control. FOUR-005 details RTMP stream receiver using process-based FFmpeg to ingest VM video at port one nine three five. FOUR-006 defines W4TCHD0G vision processing with Tesseract OCR for jackpot detection template matching for buttons and rules-based state classification. FOUR-007 establishes OBS WebSocket resilience with exponential backoff reconnection. FOUR-008 implements frame timestamp correlation for action synchronization verification. TECH-003 creates GT seven ten hardware benchmark to validate encoding performance.

Total decisions now forty-five with seventy-one action items tracked. Sixteen decisions are completed twenty are proposed and three are in progress. Four Eyes system is ready for Fixer implementation with three week estimated timeline.

Implementation sequence defined in three phases. Week one establishes foundation with VM setup host infrastructure and vision system in parallel tracks. Week two focuses on integration connecting all components and testing. Week three validates performance with hardware benchmarks and stress testing.

Oracle validation requirements include RTMP latency under three hundred milliseconds frame drop rate under one percent Synergy response under two seconds at ninety-fifth percentile OBS stability under five disconnects per twenty-four hours and vision inference under five hundred milliseconds. Recovery time must be under thirty seconds for auto-recovery.

Hardware configuration specified as VM with four cores eight gigabytes RAM running Windows ten Pro with Chrome and OBS streaming to host. Host uses AMD Ryzen nine three thousand nine hundred X with one hundred twenty-eight gigabytes RAM running Four Eyes analysis MongoDB and LM Studio inference.

Performance targets established. Stream latency under three hundred milliseconds. Action latency under two seconds. Frame drop rate under one percent. OCR accuracy ninety-five percent or higher. Recovery time under thirty seconds.

Master brief document created at T4CT1CS actions pending FOUR_EYES_MASTER_BRIEF dot m d with complete implementation specifications acceptance criteria and testing checklists. Oracle approval at eighty-seven percent with path to ninety-five percent upon completion.
