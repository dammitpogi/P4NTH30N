Oracle and Designer have completed comprehensive assessment of the decision research landscape. Their analysis reveals five critical blind spots and provides specific implementation architectures for the infrastructure decisions.

Oracle identified the highest architectural impact areas. Secrets management technology choice is foundation locking and nearly impossible to change post commitment. Core systems architecture decision is completely missing from the register and affects deployment complexity for the lifetime of the platform. ChromeDriver strategy is higher risk than initially assessed because casino sites update requirements without notice and we lack automated discovery of compatible versions.

Oracle flagged five critical blind spots. Casino site dependency risk goes beyond version management to frontend changes breaking selectors with no resilience strategy. Operational cost model is missing including MongoDB storage growth, compute costs, and monitoring platform costs at scale. Data sovereignty and regulatory risk may include state restrictions on automated casino play creating platform killer legal exposure. Multi-tenancy considerations affect configuration architecture but are unaddressed. Graceful degradation patterns for MongoDB unavailability and resource constraints are not researched.

Oracle recommends immediate action on four items within the next two weeks. Complete secrets management decision choosing between Azure Key Vault and HashiCorp Vault. Add Core Systems Architecture decision to the register immediately. Lock operating system matrix to Windows Server 2022 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for version one. Engage legal counsel for regulatory assessment before production deployment.

Designer provided detailed implementation architectures. Environment setup should use tiered support matrix with Windows primary and Ubuntu secondary. Hardware tiers should be Development at four core eight gigabytes and Production at eight core sixteen gigabytes. MongoDB version seven zero plus is recommended for self-hosted deployment.

Configuration management should use clear hierarchy with environment variables at top priority followed by user secrets, environment specific JSON, base JSON, and code defaults. Secrets management should use user secrets for development, environment variables for staging and production, with Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault for future hardening.

Continuous integration and deployment should use GitHub Actions with matrix builds for Windows and Ubuntu. Pipeline should include dependency restoration, debug build, format checking with CSharpier, unit tests, and artifact upload. Deployment should use manual gates for staging to production promotion with blue green deployment.

Monitoring stack should use Prometheus and Grafana open source stack with zero licensing cost. Key performance indicators should include signal processing ninety fifth percentile under sixty seconds, jackpot query success rate over ninety-nine point five percent, and automation success rate over ninety-eight percent. Health check endpoints should include minimal health, full health with database latency and circuit breakers, and Prometheus metrics format.

Security hardening should use incremental approach with credential encryption deferred to post-agentic phase per existing guidelines. Role-based access control should be implemented now with Admin, Operator, and Viewer roles. Audit logging should be implemented now with comprehensive event schema including timestamp, actor, action, resource, IP address, and metadata.

Both consultants agree on critical path bottlenecks. Infrastructure decisions one and two are blocking five or more other decisions through serial dependencies. Current completion rate of forty to fifty percent while marked in progress suggests research questions are harder than expected. Infrastructure ratio of thirty-three percent is healthy for foundation phase but these block all feature work.

Synthesized immediate actions include resolving secrets management technology this week, adding Core Systems Architecture decision immediately, and initiating legal regulatory assessment. ChromeDriver automated casino site probing must be added to scope. Validation execution should include full migration cycle test for secrets, thirty-day cost proof of concept for monitoring, weekly casino site probing integration test, and full continuous integration dry run.

Risk matrix shows ChromeDriver casino dependency as high severity high likelihood requiring automated site probing. Serial dependency bottleneck is high severity medium likelihood requiring parallelized research. Regulatory constraints are critical severity unknown likelihood requiring immediate legal assessment.

Next strategic review scheduled for one week to review infrastructure decisions one and two completion status, Core Systems Architecture decision, regulatory assessment findings, cost model validation, and ChromeDriver probing test results.
