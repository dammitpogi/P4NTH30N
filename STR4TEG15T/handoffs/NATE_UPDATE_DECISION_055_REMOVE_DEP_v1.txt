Nate update:

Rollback succeeded at deployment control plane but runtime still failed with the same error:
MissingEnvVarError for OPENAI_API_KEY at models.providers.openai.apiKey.

We are now executing branch `b`:
- remove the hard OpenAI API key dependency from active runtime config,
- do one controlled restart,
- run full endpoint and log validation.

This pass is constrained:
- minimal config edit only,
- no rollback/reset,
- full evidence journal output.
