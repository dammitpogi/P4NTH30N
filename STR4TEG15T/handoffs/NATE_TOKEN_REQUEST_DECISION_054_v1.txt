Nate, quick unblock request to restore OpenClaw safely.

Why we are asking:
- Current token is valid, but it is not attached to the project that hosts
  `clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app`.
- We cannot prove edit authority or apply fixes without target-project scope.

Please provide ONE of the following:

Option A (preferred):
1) Railway project token from the exact OpenClaw production project/environment.

Option B:
1) Railway account/workspace token from the account that owns that project,
2) plus confirmation of owning account email.

After receipt, we will run a reversible permission smoke test:
- set `PYXIS_ACCESS_TEST=ok`
- verify
- remove immediately

No destructive operations will be performed during this check.
