## Task: @windfixer

WindFixer, execute DECISION_113 H0UND rollout now. No planning mode.

Mode: Deployment
Decision ID: DECISION_113
Current Status: In Progress (H4ND validated; H0UND/FireKirin pending)
Requested Action: Instrument all H0UND chaos points with error evidence + sanity checks

### Scope (H0UND)

1. `H0UND/Services/Orchestration/ServiceOrchestrator.cs`
   - 116, 144, 181, 217
2. `H0UND/Application/Polling/PollingWorker.cs`
   - 22, 52, 75, 84
3. `H0UND/Infrastructure/Polling/OrionStarsBalanceProvider.cs`
   - 11, 17, 23
4. `H0UND/H0UND.cs`
   - 70-90, 224, 229, 306, 497

### Requirements

1. Reuse shared error-evidence infrastructure and `_debug` correlation model.
2. Capture `when/where/exception/context` for all failures.
3. Add pre/post sanity checks at lock, retry, anomaly callback, and coercion points.
4. Use deterministic sampling in hot polling loops; 100% capture for errors/invariant failures.
5. Keep runtime non-blocking and readable.

### Validation

1. Add/extend H0UND-focused tests in `UNI7T35T`.
2. Demonstrate chain reconstruction by `sessionId` + `correlationId` for at least 4 H0UND scenarios.
3. Provide PASS/FAIL matrix per H0UND hotspot group.

### Files to Update

- H0UND source files listed above
- `STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_113.md`
- `OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_2026-02-24_DECISION_113_H4ND_ERROR_EVIDENCE.md` (append H0UND pass section)

### Final Report Format

1. Commands executed
2. Hotspot coverage matrix (H0UND)
3. Sampling + sanity behavior summary
4. `_debug` evidence query proof
5. Files changed
6. Remaining blockers
