## Task: @openfixer

OpenFixer, execute DECISION_113 residual blocker #2 now. No planning mode.

Mode: Deployment
Decision ID: DECISION_113
Current Status: Validating
Requested Action: Run controlled Mongo-unavailable validation and capture graceful degradation evidence

### Objective

Prove `_debug` sink degradation behavior under Mongo outage with deterministic evidence artifacts.

### Required Validation

1. Simulate Mongo unavailable state for the `_debug` sink path.
2. Run H4ND path(s) that emit error evidence events.
3. Verify runtime remains stable and non-blocking.
4. Capture drop/backpressure/degradation counters from `ErrorEvidenceService` and operational logs.
5. Recover Mongo and verify system resumes normal write behavior.

### Evidence Required

1. Timeline:
   - pre-outage baseline
   - outage window
   - recovery window
2. Metrics/counters:
   - dropped events count
   - queue/backpressure counters
   - any circuit/open-state indicators
3. Runtime behavior:
   - no crash/no hard block confirmation
4. Post-recovery:
   - successful `_debug` writes observed

### Files to Update

- `OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_2026-02-24_DECISION_113_H4ND_ERROR_EVIDENCE.md`
- `STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_113.md`

### Constraints

1. No destructive data operations.
2. Keep outage test bounded and reversible.
3. Capture explicit PASS/FAIL for degradation criteria.

### Final Report Format

1. Outage method used
2. Commands executed
3. Counter evidence summary
4. Stability outcome (pass/fail)
5. Recovery outcome (pass/fail)
6. Files changed
