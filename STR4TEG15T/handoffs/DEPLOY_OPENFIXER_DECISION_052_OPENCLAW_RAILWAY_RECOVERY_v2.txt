OpenFixer, execute DECISION_052 only when Nexus explicitly initiates deployment.

Mode: Deployment
Decision ID: DECISION_052
Current status: Iterating -> HandoffReady (on Nexus initiation)

Context:
- Decision: STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RAILWAY_RECOVERY.md
- Control-plane decision: STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_053_OPENCLAW_RAILWAY_ACCESS_STRATEGY.md
- Outage evidence: https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app returns HTTP 503
- Railway dashboard: https://railway.com/dashboard
- Access: Nexus-provided in-session credentials only; do not persist secrets

Mission:
Restore OpenClaw to HTTP 200 using rollback-first posture and produce audit evidence.

Execution phases:
1) Stabilize (web UI first unless Nexus explicitly selects API)
   - Log in to Railway.
   - Identify last successful deployment and broken deployment.
   - Roll back to last successful deployment.
   - Verify HTTP 200 on production URL within 60 seconds.

2) Restore
   - Validate health/core routes 3x consecutively.
   - Review logs for crash loops/startup failures.
   - Confirm no active 5xx spike.

3) Validate
   - Test `/setup` and `/openclaw` surfaces.
   - Confirm OpenClaw Railway baseline settings remain aligned:
     - HTTP proxy port 8080
     - `PORT=8080`
     - volume mounted at `/data`
   - Run 10-request spot check with zero 5xx.

4) Prevent (document only in this pass)
   - Capture root cause hypothesis from deployment diff/logs.
   - Recommend at least 3 prevention controls.

Required artifacts:
- OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RECOVERY.md
- Update STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RAILWAY_RECOVERY.md with deployment IDs, timestamps, and validation evidence.

Report format:
1. Actions performed (ordered)
2. Evidence (status codes, deployment IDs, key logs)
3. Validation matrix (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)
4. Root cause hypothesis + confidence
5. Residual risks + next actions

Constraints:
- No workflow bypass.
- No secret persistence.
- Rollback-first during outage window.
- If rollback is blocked by migration/state risk, stop and escalate to Nexus with evidence.
