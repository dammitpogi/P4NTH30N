## Task: @windfixer

WindFixer, execute DECISION_113 closure validation in ONE pass. You have CLI access. Do not stop in planning mode.

We are past implementation. We now need proof. If we skip this, DECISION_113 cannot close.

Mode: Deployment
Decision ID: DECISION_113
Current Status: InProgress (H4ND Phase 1)
Requested Action: Complete all 3 closure gates in one execution pass

### Gate 1 — Fault-Injection Validation (Top 5 Concurrency Hotspots)

Run targeted fault-injection tests and capture evidence that `_debug` records can reconstruct failure chains by `sessionId` and `correlationId`.

Hotspots to validate:
1. `H4ND/Services/LegacyRuntimeHost.cs:260-263` (early ack path)
2. `H4ND/Services/LegacyRuntimeHost.cs:578-601` (unlock-before-persist window)
3. `H4ND/Infrastructure/SpinExecution.cs:53` (ack ownership overlap)
4. `H4ND/Services/LegacyRuntimeHost.cs:482,507,532,557` (`DeleteAll` branch behavior)
5. `H4ND/Parallel/ParallelSpinWorker.cs:218-220,235-237` (retry + claim release)

Required outputs for Gate 1:
- test name + scenario + expected failure
- observed `_debug` document count per scenario
- one sample correlation chain per scenario (event order)
- pass/fail matrix for all 5 hotspots

### Gate 2 — MongoDB `_debug` TTL/Index Verification

Verify in runtime environment that required indexes exist and are active:
- TTL on `expiresAt`
- `{ sessionId: 1, capturedAt: -1 }`
- `{ correlationId: 1, capturedAt: -1 }`
- `{ component: 1, operation: 1, capturedAt: -1 }`
- `{ errorCode: 1, capturedAt: -1 }`

Required outputs for Gate 2:
- index list evidence (names + key definitions + TTL config)
- explicit PASS/FAIL per required index
- remediation applied if missing (create index and re-verify)

### Gate 3 — Closure Checklist Draft and Decision Artifact Update

Update decision artifacts with closure-ready evidence.

Files to update:
- `STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_113.md`
- `OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_2026-02-24_DECISION_113_H4ND_ERROR_EVIDENCE.md`

Add:
- closure checklist with explicit checkboxes and outcomes
- fault-injection summary table
- index verification table
- remaining risk items (if any) with owner and next action

### Hard Constraints

1. Do not remove existing telemetry behavior.
2. Do not downgrade capture for errors/invariant failures (must remain 100%).
3. If Mongo is unavailable, validation must still report graceful degradation behavior.
4. Keep edits minimal and readable.

### Final Report Format (single response)

1. Commands/tests executed
2. Gate 1 result (5-hotspot matrix)
3. Gate 2 result (index/TTL matrix)
4. Files changed
5. Closure checklist status
6. Open blockers (if any)
