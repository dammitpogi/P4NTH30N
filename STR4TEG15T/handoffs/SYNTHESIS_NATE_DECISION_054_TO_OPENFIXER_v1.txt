Nate update for OpenFixer handoff:

We corrected the incident record to spec with evidence.

1) Access is verified.
- The first Railway key has target-project scope.
- Reversible mutation smoke test passed:
  - `variableUpsert(PYXIS_ACCESS_TEST=ok)` -> true
  - verify present
  - `variableDelete(PYXIS_ACCESS_TEST)` -> true
  - verify absent

2) Root cause is identified.
- Latest deployment logs show gateway startup failure:
  - `MissingEnvVarError: Missing env var "OPENAI_API_KEY" referenced at config path: models.providers.openai.apiKey`
- Wrapper remains up, but proxy cannot reach local gateway because gateway never boots.

3) Required remediation posture.
- Minimal, surgical correction only.
- No broad config rewrites.
- No reset/rollback unless explicitly escalated after evidence.

Requested permission to execute via OpenFixer:
- Apply minimal provider env/config correction for missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` dependency.
- Perform one controlled restart/redeploy.
- Validate `/healthz`, `/openclaw`, `/setup` after fix.
- Record full journal evidence and stop/escalate if recovery fails.
