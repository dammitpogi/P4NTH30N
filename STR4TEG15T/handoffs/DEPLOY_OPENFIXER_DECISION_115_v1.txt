OpenFixer, execute DECISION_115 when Nexus explicitly initiates this deployment.

Context:
- Parent workflow decision: STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md
- Governance decision: STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_115.md
- Governance companion: STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_115_DEPLOYMENT_GOVERNANCE_v1.md
- Strategist policy target: C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\strategist.md

Mission:
Implement deployment-phase decision governance so strategist handoffs always include pre-handoff scope questions, closure checklist drafting, and controlled handling of in-flight deployment decision deltas.

Do this in order:
1) Read DECISION_114 and DECISION_115 artifacts and verify policy parity with strategist.md.
2) Update strategist.md to enforce automatic pre-handoff gates:
   - harden/expand/narrow question set,
   - closure checklist draft,
   - deployment-phase status transitions,
   - versioned companion file rule for scope deltas.
3) Update DECISION_114 with a closure checklist block aligned to DECISION_115 governance rules.
4) If governance language needs expansion, update/create versioned companion docs and link them clearly.
5) Produce deployment report with governance parity evidence.

Required outputs:
- OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_115_DEPLOYMENT_GOVERNANCE.md
- Updated C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\strategist.md
- Updated STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md (closure checklist integration)
- Any versioned decision companion docs created during execution

Report back with:
- files changed,
- checklist of requirements met,
- unresolved blockers,
- recommendation: DECISION_114 ready to close or further iteration needed.

Constraints:
- No product code modifications in H0UND/, H4ND/, C0MMON/, W4TCHD0G/, UNI7T35T/.
- No synthesis speech file creation unless Nexus explicitly requests it.
- Keep evidence path-explicit and audit-friendly.
