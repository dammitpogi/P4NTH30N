OpenFixer, execute dependency-removal remediation now.

Mode: Deployment
Decision IDs: DECISION_052, DECISION_054, DECISION_055

Nexus approval: granted for branch `b` (remove dependency).

Objective:
Remove hard runtime dependency on `OPENAI_API_KEY` from active OpenClaw config path so gateway can boot without that env var.

Strict constraints:
1) Minimal config edit only (dependency removal path).
2) One controlled restart only.
3) No rollback/reset in this pass.
4) No secret persistence in repo artifacts.

Target:
- projectId: 1256dcd2-0929-417a-8f32-39137ffa523b
- environmentId: 3ba89542-4d69-44cf-9a98-92f0058c30aa
- serviceId: 2224d9e4-80a7-49d5-b2d4-cf37385fc843

Execution steps:
1) Capture pre-change state:
   - `/healthz`, `/setup`, `/openclaw`
   - deployment logs showing current MissingEnvVarError
2) Edit active config path currently referenced in logs (`/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json`) to remove hard `models.providers.openai.apiKey` dependency.
   - Keep the rest of config behavior intact.
   - If provider fallback is required, choose a non-openai path already supported by existing env/config.
3) Trigger one controlled restart.
4) Validate 3 rounds:
   - `/healthz`, `/setup`, `/openclaw`
5) Run 10-request `/openclaw` spot check.
6) Pull logs and confirm whether MissingEnvVarError OPENAI_API_KEY is gone.

Stop condition:
- Stop after one pass and report final state.

Required artifact:
- `OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_2026-02-24_DECISION_055_OPENCLAW_REMOVE_OPENAI_DEP.md`

Report format:
1) Ordered actions
2) Exact config delta summary
3) Validation matrix
4) Key log deltas
5) Final state: Recovered / Partial / Not recovered
