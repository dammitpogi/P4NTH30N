OpenFixer, execute rollback only after explicit Nexus approval is confirmed in this pass.

Mode: Deployment
Action: Controlled rollback execution
Decision IDs: DECISION_052, DECISION_054, DECISION_055

Execution gate:
- REQUIRED: Nexus approval present in current pass.
- If approval is absent, stop immediately and return "BLOCKED: Nexus approval required".

Target service:
- URL: https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app
- projectId: 1256dcd2-0929-417a-8f32-39137ffa523b
- environmentId: 3ba89542-4d69-44cf-9a98-92f0058c30aa
- serviceId: 2224d9e4-80a7-49d5-b2d4-cf37385fc843

Rollback target:
- deploymentId: b7d30dd4-d5b7-4135-90e5-9074ddeafb34
- reason: latest prior rollback-eligible deployment before current active deployment f578fd88-5994-4527-8797-9b1c57e2e725.

Execution steps:
1) Re-validate target deployment metadata (`status`, `canRollback`) immediately before mutation.
2) Capture pre-rollback probes for `/healthz`, `/setup`, `/openclaw`.
3) Execute one rollback mutation to target deployment id.
4) Run 3 validation rounds for `/healthz`, `/setup`, `/openclaw`.
5) Run 10-request `/openclaw` spot check.
6) Pull deployment logs and check:
   - MissingEnvVarError for OPENAI_API_KEY
   - config path (`/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json` vs `/data/.openclaw/openclaw.json`)

Report format:
1) Ordered actions
2) Exact rollback mutation result
3) Validation matrix
4) Key log deltas
5) Final state: Recovered / Partial / Not recovered
