OpenFixer, execute this discovery package only when Nexus explicitly initiates discovery.

Mode: Inquiry
Decision ID: DECISION_054
Current status: Approved

Context:
- STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_054_OPENCLAW_INCIDENT_DISCOVERY_PLAN.md
- STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RAILWAY_RECOVERY.md
- Target URL: https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app
- Railway endpoint: https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2

Mission:
Collect read-only evidence to classify outage root-cause bucket. Do not perform rollback/redeploy/restart.

Execution:
1) Validate Railway token type and scope
2) Resolve project/environment/service identifiers
3) List last 10 deployments and identify rollback candidate
4) Pull build logs and runtime logs for latest failed/crashed deployment
5) Check variable baseline (`PORT`, OpenClaw state/workspace vars) and volume mount evidence
6) Produce classification: RuntimeCrash | PortProxyMismatch | EnvDrift | DependencyFailure | Unknown

Required artifacts:
- OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_054_DISCOVERY.md
- Decision update note appended to DECISION_052 with findings summary

Report format:
1. Token type and scope
2. IDs discovered (project/environment/service)
3. Deployment table (last 10)
4. Log excerpts (key lines only)
5. Variable baseline results
6. Classification + confidence + recommended next action

Constraints:
- Read-only operations only.
- No secret persistence.
- No deployment mutations in discovery pass.
