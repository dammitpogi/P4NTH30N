OpenFixer, execute this package when Nexus explicitly initiates deployment.

Mode: Deployment
Decision: DECISION_115
Status: Iterating
Objective: Implement runtime governance lint/check automation and structured-ask validation.

Context:
- STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_115.md
- STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md
- C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\strategist.md
- C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\openfixer.md
- STR4TEG15T/memory/tools/

Mission:
Implement ACT-115-009 and ACT-115-011 by creating a governance lint utility that verifies pre-handoff completeness and structured Nexus ask format.
Also implement ACT-115-016 by adding automatic OpenFixer prompt parity checks each lint run.

Required lint checks:
1) Pre-handoff governance completeness:
   - harden question present (canonical token: `Harden:`)
   - expand question present (canonical token: `Expand:`)
   - narrow question present (canonical token: `Narrow:`)
   - closure checklist draft present
   - deployment delta handling reference present
2) Structured ask format in strategist-facing prompts:
   - numbered question blocks detected
   - lettered choices detected (`a)`, `b)`, ...)
   - recommended default present for each decision-point question
   - mode/decision/status header present
3) Automatic OpenFixer prompt parity check:
   - compare `C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\openfixer.md` vs `C:\P4NTHE0N\agents\openfixer.md`
   - report PASS when equivalent on governance sections, FAIL with explicit diff summary when drift exists
   - execute automatically on each governance lint run (no explicit Nexus trigger required)

Deliverables:
- Tooling changes under STR4TEG15T/memory/tools/ (or nearest governance tooling location)
- Deployment report: OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_115_GOVERNANCE_LINT.md
- Decision evidence updates in STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_115.md
- Parity check output artifact (machine-readable), for example: `STR4TEG15T/memory/decision-engine/openfixer-prompt-parity.json`

Report format:
1. Files changed
2. Commands run
3. Lint validation matrix (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)
4. Example output for one passing and one failing case
5. Closure recommendation for DECISION_115

Constraints:
- No product code changes in H0UND/, H4ND/, C0MMON/, W4TCHD0G/, UNI7T35T/.
- No synthesis speech artifacts.
- Keep implementation idempotent, path-explicit, and CI-friendly.
