OpenFixer, execute DECISION_114 handoff when Nexus explicitly initiates deployment.

Context:
- Decision: STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md
- Handoff: STR4TEG15T/handoffs/DECISION_114_OPENFIXER_HANDOFF_v1.md
- Strategist policy target: C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\strategist.md

Mission:
Operationalize and validate strategist workflow hardening for planning-to-deployment governance, including consistent decision file handling and deployment reporting standards.

Do this in order:
1) Read and validate policy parity across:
   - STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md
   - STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114_CHANGE_CONTROL_v1.md
   - STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114_SYNTHESIS_POLICY_v1.md
   - C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\strategist.md
2) Apply any required prompt/config edits to preserve all DECISION_114 requirements.
3) Verify workflow contains:
   - explicit states and gates,
   - SyncQueued fallback behavior,
   - consultation timeout/arbitration,
   - deletion protocol with reason-before-attempt,
   - pass discipline questions (harden/expand/narrow),
   - synthesis gate (no speech output unless requested),
   - per-pass manifest update requirement,
   - explicit strategist role boundary (no implementation work).
4) Ensure consistent file-handling policy is documented and enforceable:
   - minor changes in-place,
   - major changes in versioned companion docs,
   - decision file length hygiene (<1000 lines via references where needed).
5) Handle ongoing deployment governance:
   - if deployment scope expands, create a versioned companion decision file and link to DECISION_114,
   - capture rationale and status in deployment journal.

Expected output artifacts (required):
- OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_114_WORKFLOW_HARDENING.md
- Decision evidence updates in STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md
- Any new versioned companion decision file if scope changed

Report back with:
- exact files changed,
- validation checklist outcomes,
- pending blockers,
- recommendation: ready to close DECISION_114 or keep Iterating/HandoffReady.

Constraints:
- Do not modify product code in H0UND/, H4ND/, C0MMON/, W4TCHD0G/, UNI7T35T/.
- Do not create synthesis speech artifacts unless Nexus explicitly requests synthesis.
- Keep changes audit-friendly and path-explicit.
