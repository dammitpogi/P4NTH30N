Nate update:

We completed the first minimal fix pass and the service is still not recovered.

What was done:
- Corrected `CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR` to `/data/.openclaw`.
- Performed one controlled restart.
- Re-ran health probes and spot checks.

Outcome:
- `/healthz` remains 200 and `/setup` remains 401 (wrapper/auth shell alive),
- `/openclaw` remains 503/timeout (gateway still failing).
- Logs still show `MissingEnvVarError` for `OPENAI_API_KEY` at `models.providers.openai.apiKey`.

Next safest move (approved minimal pass 2):
- Apply exactly one additional config-path correction:
  `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw`
- Perform one controlled restart,
- Re-run the same validation matrix,
- Stop and escalate to rollback gate if still unhealthy.

No broad rewrites, no rollback/reset in this pass.
