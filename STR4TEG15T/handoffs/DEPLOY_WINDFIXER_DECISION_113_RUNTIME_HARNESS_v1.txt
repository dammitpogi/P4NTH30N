## Task: @windfixer

WindFixer, execute DECISION_113 residual blocker #1 now. No planning mode.

Mode: Deployment
Decision ID: DECISION_113
Current Status: Validating
Requested Action: Build runtime-native hotspot fault harness and validate direct code-path evidence

### Objective

Create a deterministic runtime-native hotspot harness under `UNI7T35T/H4ND` that triggers the top-5 concurrency hotspots through real code paths (not DB-level injection), then verifies `_debug` evidence chain integrity.

### Required Hotspots

1. `H4ND/Services/LegacyRuntimeHost.cs:260-263` (early ack path)
2. `H4ND/Services/LegacyRuntimeHost.cs:578-601` (unlock-before-persist)
3. `H4ND/Infrastructure/SpinExecution.cs:53` (ack ownership overlap)
4. `H4ND/Services/LegacyRuntimeHost.cs:482,507,532,557` (`DeleteAll` branch)
5. `H4ND/Parallel/ParallelSpinWorker.cs:218-220,235-237` (retry + claim release)

### Deliverables

1. Add deterministic test harness and tests in `UNI7T35T/H4ND`.
2. For each hotspot, execute native fault path and assert:
   - expected `errorCode`/event markers emitted
   - `sessionId` + `correlationId` chain reconstructs in order
   - evidence document includes `where/when/exception` envelope fields
3. Emit per-hotspot PASS/FAIL matrix.

### Constraints

1. Do not change production semantics beyond testability hooks.
2. Keep instrumentation overhead minimal.
3. Fail tests on missing correlation chain continuity.

### Files to Update

- `UNI7T35T/H4ND/*` (new harness + tests)
- Any minimal production seams required for deterministic fault triggering

### Final Report Format

1. Tests added
2. Commands executed
3. 5-hotspot native matrix
4. Files changed
5. Remaining gaps (if any)
