Nate update:

Branch-b pass to remove OpenAI dependency completed.
Result: OpenAI missing-env error cleared, but service is still not recovered.

New blocker now surfaced in logs:
- MissingEnvVarError for GEMINI_API_KEY at models.providers.google.apiKey.

Next constrained step:
- remove hard Gemini API key dependency from active config,
- one controlled restart,
- full endpoint + log validation,
- no rollback/reset in this pass.
