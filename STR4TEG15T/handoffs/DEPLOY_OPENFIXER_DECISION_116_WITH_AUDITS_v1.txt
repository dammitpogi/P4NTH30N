Mission:
Implement DECISION_116 automation foundations and perform the DECISION_114 + DECISION_115 audits in the same session for context/token efficiency.

Execution Order:
1) Implementation pass (DECISION_116)
   - Implement decision-status index generation automation (flat directory model, no by-status folder assumptions).
   - Implement manifest v2 storage scaffolding for events/views/snapshots/archive/catalog.
   - Implement baseline integrity checks (event/view parity, replay consistency, checksum verification hooks).
   - Keep changes to strategist workflow/tooling domains only.

2) Audit pass A (DECISION_114)
   - Verify deployed behavior against decision contract.
   - Confirm unresolved blockers and closure readiness gates.

3) Audit pass B (DECISION_115)
   - Verify manual Nexus-initiation gate and governance controls are actually enforceable.
   - Validate whether openfixer prompt standards need further hardening.

4) Consolidated guidance output
   - Provide operations guidance for: configure, triage, repair, and rollback.
   - Provide how-to guidance for using new automation in future decisions.

Report Format (single response):
1. Files changed
2. Commands run
3. Validation matrix (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL per requirement)
4. Unresolved blockers
5. Triage/repair runbook summary
6. Closure recommendation for each decision:
