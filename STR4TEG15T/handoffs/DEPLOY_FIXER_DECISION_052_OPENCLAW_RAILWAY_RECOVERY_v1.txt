Fixer, execute DECISION_052 only when Nexus explicitly initiates deployment.

Mode: Deployment
Decision ID: DECISION_052
Current status: Approved -> HandoffReady (on Nexus initiation)

Context:
- Decision: STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RAILWAY_RECOVERY.md
- Outage evidence: production URL returns HTTP 503
- Production URL: https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app
- Railway dashboard: https://railway.com/dashboard
- Credentials: use Nexus-provided in-session credentials only (do not persist)

Mission:
Restore OpenClaw service to HTTP 200 as fast as possible using rollback-first posture, then validate and document.

Execution order:
1) Stabilize
   - Log in to Railway dashboard.
   - Identify broken deployment and last known good deployment.
   - Execute rollback/restore to last known good deployment immediately.
   - Verify production URL returns HTTP 200 within 60 seconds.

2) Restore
   - Validate health endpoint(s) and core route(s) 3 consecutive times.
   - Check logs for startup errors and restart loops.
   - Confirm no active 5xx spike.

3) Validate
   - Run a minimal synthetic journey for OpenClaw core path.
   - Confirm DB/integration connectivity if visible in logs/status.
   - Perform a 10-request spot check with zero 5xx.

4) Prevent
   - Capture root cause candidate from bad deployment diff/logs.
   - Propose at least 3 prevention controls (deploy gates, alerts, config validation).

Required artifacts:
- OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RECOVERY.md
- Update STR4TEG15T/decisions/DECISION_052_OPENCLAW_RAILWAY_RECOVERY.md with:
  - exact deployment IDs (good/bad),
  - timeline timestamps,
  - final status transition to Closed only if validation passes.

Report format:
1. Actions performed (ordered)
2. Evidence (status codes, deployment IDs, key log lines)
3. Validation checklist (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)
4. Root cause hypothesis and confidence
5. Remaining risks and recommended follow-up

Constraints:
- Prioritize rollback over fix-forward during outage window.
- Do not store secrets in repo files.
- Do not modify product source code unless rollback cannot restore service.
- If rollback fails and migration/state risk is detected, stop and report before destructive recovery steps.
