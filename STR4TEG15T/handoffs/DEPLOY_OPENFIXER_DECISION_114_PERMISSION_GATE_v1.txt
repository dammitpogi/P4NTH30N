OpenFixer, execute this package when Nexus explicitly initiates deployment.

Mode: Deployment
Decision: DECISION_114
Status: HandoffReady (blocked on OpenCode ask-permission provenance)
Objective: Implement OpenCode permission-gate configuration so strategist deletion tests produce OpenCode-originated ask/allow evidence.

Context:
- STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md
- C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\opencode.json
- C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\agents\strategist.md

Mission:
1) Configure strategist deletion-capable path so OpenCode emits permission ask events (path `1a` selected by Nexus).
2) Use least-disruptive configuration that preserves strategist editing workflow while making deletion audit provenance explicit.
3) Document exact config rationale and tradeoffs.
4) Provide a deterministic re-test procedure for DECISION_114 deletion protocol validation.

Required outputs:
- Updated `C:\Users\paulc\.config\opencode\opencode.json`
- Deployment journal: `OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_YYYY-MM-DD_DECISION_114_PERMISSION_GATE.md`
- Decision evidence update in `STR4TEG15T/decisions/active/DECISION_114.md`

Report format:
1. Files changed
2. Commands run
3. Permission-gate change summary (before/after)
4. Re-test checklist for OpenCode ask provenance
5. Remaining blockers and recommendation

Constraints:
- No product code changes.
- Keep config changes minimal and reversible.
- Prioritize explicit ask-permission provenance over convenience for deletion operations.
