Decision IDs: DECISION_052, DECISION_054, DECISION_055
Current status: HandoffReady -> Deploying

Target service:
- URL: https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app
- Railway projectId: 1256dcd2-0929-417a-8f32-39137ffa523b
- Railway environmentId: 3ba89542-4d69-44cf-9a98-92f0058c30aa (production)
- Railway serviceId: 2224d9e4-80a7-49d5-b2d4-cf37385fc843

Verified evidence:
- Deployment edit authority verified via reversible variable upsert/delete.
- Latest deployment logs show root cause:
  MissingEnvVarError: Missing env var "OPENAI_API_KEY" referenced at models.providers.openai.apiKey
- Wrapper up, gateway down; /openclaw returns 502/503.

Mission:
Restore gateway startup with minimal config correction and controlled restart.

Execution constraints:
1) Minimal-change remediation only; no broad config rewrites.
2) Do not store secrets in repository artifacts.
3) If a new provider key is required and unavailable, use a config-path fix that removes hard dependency on OPENAI_API_KEY rather than fabricating values.
4) No rollback/reset unless minimal fix fails and you provide evidence first.

Execution steps:
1. Snapshot current state
   - Record current variables and latest deployment id.
   - Record /healthz, /setup, /openclaw status codes.

2. Apply minimal fix
   - Resolve missing OPENAI_API_KEY dependency by one of:
     a) safely supplying existing valid secret from approved source, OR
     b) editing config to remove/replace provider path requiring OPENAI_API_KEY.
   - Keep all other unrelated settings intact.

3. Restart/redeploy once
   - Trigger one controlled restart/redeploy.

4. Validate
   - Probe /healthz, /setup, /openclaw at least 3 times.
   - Confirm gateway reachable true and no startup MissingEnvVarError.
   - Confirm zero 5xx in a 10-request spot check on /openclaw.

5. Stop condition
   - If not recovered after one pass, stop and return evidence + next safest option.
