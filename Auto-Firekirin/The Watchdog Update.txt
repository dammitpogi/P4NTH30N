The Watchdog Update

---

Deploy a MongoDB Server on CATH3DR4L-01. Create HUN7ER. PROF3T-07 to H0UND_007. Populate Credentials for HOUND_007. Populate H0USEs and SIGN4Ls. PROF3T Naming convention change: "H4ND_001 - Paul Celebrado"

---

The front end, identified as HUN7ER, will function as an API for the H0UNDs. Display info on the PROF3Ts. Provide a platform for a future control system and Quality of Life macros.

PROF3Ts will now function as one of two codependent roles. Identified as either a H4ND or a H0UND.

H0UNDs: Transmits Jackpot info to listener by cycling through credentials. 

H4NDs: Queries database for active signals. Received signals are prioritized and checked for a match within the H4ND's credentials. Signals are spun in order of (A) Priority-descending (B) countdown to Pop (C) current house balance (descending)

PROF3T-07 will be the first H0UND. Due to a lack of linked payment methods. Difficult to withdraw without.

The 5x Game has a maximum drawdown of 0.16 per minute. Recommending starting spins 20 minutes prior to jackpot based on DPD.

Jackpots for all G4MEs should be stored and tracked.
