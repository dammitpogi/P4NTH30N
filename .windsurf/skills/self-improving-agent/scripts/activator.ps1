After completing this task, evaluate if extractable knowledge emerged:
- Non-obvious solution discovered through investigation?
- Workaround for unexpected behavior?
- Project-specific pattern learned?
- Error required debugging to resolve?

If yes: Log to .learnings/ using the self-improvement skill format.
If high-value (recurring, broadly applicable): Consider skill extraction.
