# Revision Rubric

Use separate passes, in this order.

## Pass 1: Structural Integrity

- Chapter sequence supports the promised transformation.
- Redundant sections are merged or removed.
- Missing bridge sections are inserted where logic jumps.

## Pass 2: Argument and Narrative Strength

- Claims are supported by evidence, examples, or reasoning.
- Story beats have setup, development, and payoff.
- Contradictions are removed across chapters.

## Pass 3: Clarity and Readability

- Paragraphs hold one main idea each.
- Dense sections are split or simplified.
- Jargon is defined or replaced for target readers.

## Pass 4: Line Quality

- Verb-heavy, direct phrasing replaces weak abstractions.
- Repetition and filler are trimmed aggressively.
- Voice remains consistent with the book profile.

## Finish Check

A section is finish-ready when it serves the chapter outcome, reads clearly aloud, and does not introduce unresolved promises.
