# Book Blueprint

Use this before drafting large sections.

## Promise Stack

- Reader: Who is this for?
- Problem: What pain or ambition is driving them?
- Transformation: What changes after finishing the book?
- Constraint: What this book intentionally does not cover.

## Positioning Choices

- Primary category and shelf expectation.
- Main differentiator versus common alternatives.
- Credibility source: lived experience, research, case studies, or framework.

## Structural Backbone

- Opening hook and trust signal.
- Core arc: progressive sequence that avoids repetitive chapter flow.
- Mid-book acceleration: where stakes or usefulness clearly increase.
- Ending payoff: explicit completion state for the reader.

## Chapter Map Template

| Chapter | One-sentence purpose | Reader outcome | Evidence/story assets |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

## Exit Criteria

A blueprint is ready when each chapter has a unique purpose, each purpose ladders to the same promise, and no chapter exists only for filler.
