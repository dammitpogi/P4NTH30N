# Chapter Loop

Run this loop per chapter to protect quality and momentum.

## 1. Define the Chapter Contract

- Outcome: what the reader can do, understand, or feel after this chapter.
- Inputs: prerequisite context from prior chapters.
- Boundary: what belongs in this chapter versus later sections.

## 2. Draft in One Direction

- Draft from opening to close without micro-editing.
- Mark uncertain points inline with simple placeholders like `[verify source]`.
- Avoid perfection passes during first draft flow.

## 3. Validate Coherence

Check quickly before finalizing:

- Does the opening match the promised outcome?
- Is each section earning its place?
- Is there one clear through-line?
- Does the close transition naturally to the next chapter?

## 4. Capture Decisions

Log in memory:

- Scope changes.
- Voice or tone adjustments.
- New risks that can affect future chapters.
