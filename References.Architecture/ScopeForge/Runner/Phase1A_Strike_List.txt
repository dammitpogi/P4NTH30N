Phase 1A — Strike List (Mobile “Eyes + Baton”)

Objective
Ship the smallest decisive “mobile runner” that can safely trigger governed sessions, capture inputs, and emit Vault-first evidence for replay.

S1 — Activation & Baton Control
1) Controlled Activation only
- Require explicit user intent phrase / UI toggle (e.g., “DEV MODE ON”).
- Hard-fail if activation signal is missing.

2) Dormant-by-default
- No background behavior.
- No proactive tool calls.
- No periodic checks.

3) Session scope lock
- Each run has: runId, bundleId, purpose, allowed tools, allowed data sources.
- Enforce “one session = one scope.”

S2 — Identity + Session Handshake
4) Whisper handshake (minimal)
- Start-of-session handshake packet:
  - runId
  - bundleId (Canon/Forge/Vault versions)
  - requestType (read/analyze/plan/execute)
  - toolPolicyRef
  - user-confirm flag

5) Named identity attribution
- Every output declares role (Atlas-mode on mobile) + session runId.

S3 — Vault-First Evidence (Replayability)
6) Vault event stream on every run
- Record: prompt/input, parameters, tool calls (even denied), outputs, errors.
- Append-only; no edits.

7) Hashes for integrity
- inputsHash, paramsHash, artifactsHash.
- Store hashes in the Vault run record.

8) Evidence Mode fallback
- If blocked or uncertain: emit a blocked-action capsule → stop.

S4 — Tool Boundary Enforcement (Mobile)
9) Deniest possible default
- Tools OFF unless explicitly allowed in-session.
- Allowlist is per-run, not global.

10) Schema validation
- Reject unknown fields.
- Reject oversized payloads.
- Reject ambiguous targets (no wildcard destinations).

11) Rate limits + timeouts
- Tight defaults on mobile.
- Fail closed (no retries that change intent).

S5 — Data Handling & Privacy
12) Local-first capture
- Keep intermediate notes local to session context.
- Persist only via Vault/Forge artifacts.

13) No hidden persistence
- No writing to arbitrary files.
- No “remember this” behavior outside Vault/Forge.

14) Redaction gate
- Auto-redact secrets / tokens / keys if detected.
- If unsure: Evidence Mode capsule.

S6 — Outputs (Atlasian-compliant)
15) Short structured outputs
- Compliance header line.
- Minimal paragraphs.
- Clear “What happened / What emitted / What next.”

16) No transcript dumps
- Summarize; quote only short fragments when necessary.

S7 — Transport / Sync (Mobile → Laptop)
17) Artifact packaging
- Emit a single “Run Bundle” directory:
  - CANON (read-only copy)
  - FORGE (if updated)
  - VAULT (append)
  - run_record.json
  - tool_log.json

18) Safe handoff contract
- Laptop runner must verify hashes + bundleId match before executing.

S8 — Acceptance Gates (done = shippable)
A) Mobile runner refuses to operate without activation phrase/toggle.
B) Every run produces a Vault run record with hashes + tool log.
C) Tools are deny-by-default; allowlist is per-run.
D) Blocked-action capsule path exists and terminates execution.
E) Handoff bundle verifies on laptop (hash check passes).
