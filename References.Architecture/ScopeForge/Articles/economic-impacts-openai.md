## Overview

OpenAI states that understanding the economic impacts of its models on individuals and society is core to its mission, and that rigorous measurement is important for:
- smarter development and deployment decisions, and
- informing public policy options to maximize prosperity and minimize economic harms from AI.

OpenAI also emphasizes the importance of developing research partnerships and supporting external researchers (rather than relying only on in-house research).

OpenAI links to its first public research agenda on these topics (hosted on cdn.openai.com) and announces:
- a call for expressions of interest from researchers to study the economic impacts of Codex and other model releases (including GPT‑3, ChatGPT, and DALL·E 2), and
- a portal for customers to submit interest in supporting this work.

## Importance of studying economic impacts

OpenAI notes that decisions around AI system design and deployment can influence economic impacts and how benefits are distributed.

The page highlights concerns that:
- gains in prosperity have not been widely distributed over recent decades, and
- in the US, income and wealth inequality trends over roughly the past 40 years reflect increasing divergence and uneven access to opportunity.

It also states that, while evidence suggests little immediate risk of widespread technological unemployment due to AI, labor market impacts may vary widely across worker types. The page cites research indicating unemployment shocks can negatively affect wellbeing and that rising inequality can amplify societal cleavages.

OpenAI says it wants research that can inform decision-making across three axes:
1. AI deployment policies  
2. AI system design decisions  
3. Public policy interventions that draw upon real-world evidence  

The page adds that research on current models is needed to help assess the safety of developing and releasing more capable systems in the future, and points to Codex, DALL·E 2, and ChatGPT as “tractable opportunities” to establish foundations for this research.

## Submission process for researchers

OpenAI states it is seeking submissions from PhD-level researchers, including current doctoral students.

The page says collaborations could take different forms, including:
- connection to a larger research cohort,
- invitations to participate in red teaming exercises, and/or
- API credit grants.

OpenAI says it will tailor partnerships with potential collaborators to support productive working relationships.

The page also notes that, over time, OpenAI would like to connect researchers to customers building products on top of large language models that directly impact workers and consumers.

Evaluation criteria for expressions of interest (as described on the page):
- background and experience,
- clarity of motivation to collaborate with OpenAI,
- clarity and decision-relevance of research interests to the economic impact of large language models.

## Submission process for companies and users of OpenAI tools

OpenAI states it is working on connecting researchers with firms best equipped to support particular research interests, and intends to facilitate discussions among:
- external researchers,
- AI developers,
- AI-adopting firms, and
- workers in industries affected by advances in AI,

to widen the range of perspectives shaping AI development and deployment.
