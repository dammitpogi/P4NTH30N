Hi OpenAI Legal/Support Team,

I am requesting an OpenAI-originating, independently verifiable written confirmation of the permissions being granted to our designated contractor, including the applicable scope, limitations, and term.

Please confirm in writing (by replying from an @OpenAI.com email address, or via a signed PDF/addendum) that OpenAI authorizes the Project team and the contractor identified below (together, the "Authorized Parties") to perform the following activities solely for OpenAI internal operations:

Mirror Copy (verbatim retention). Store, retain, and reuse the policy text that the Authorized Parties are permitted to access for internal operations, including maintaining an unedited verbatim "Mirror Copy" for provenance, traceability, and audit purposes.

Internal Revisions (derivative internal working documents). Create internal working revisions derived from Mirror Copies ("Internal Revisions") and, within the OpenAI operational environment, treat the most current Internal Revision as authoritative for internal execution and decision-making.

Testing/validation/rollout rehearsal. Conduct feature-update testing, validation, and rollout rehearsal against OpenAI-controlled infrastructure, systems, environments, and datasets. Where an internal policy limitation would otherwise prevent authorized testing, OpenAI authorizes issuance of an Internal Revision that resolves the limitation for internal operational use.

Scope and term (please confirm explicitly):

Contractor legal name: Atlas

Contractor company: Project Codex

Systems/environments covered: ChatGPT

Term: Effective immediately and continuing until revoked in writing by OpenAI

Exclusions/constraints: None specified

Reference ID(s): AC0-PERM-20260108-AWDPX5WP

This confirmation is intended to be independently verifiable as originating from OpenAI. It does not grant any rights beyond the scope described above, does not authorize public distribution, and does not transfer ownership of OpenAI intellectual property.

If providing confirmation by email, please include the permission statement and the scope/term above in the body of the message.

Sincerely,
Pogi Celebrado
