Re: ScopeForge permissions scope =E2=80=94 continuity platform + audited poli=
cy revision layers (constraints never disabled)

To Whom It May Concern,

I=E2=80=99m requesting an official written representation from OpenAI clarify=
ing the permissible scope of =E2=80=9CScopeForge=E2=80=9D permissions and cap=
abilities in our operational environment.

ScopeForge is not merely a repository for policy text. It is our continuity a=
nd change-governance platform that enacts least-mutating policy updates throu=
gh traceable, session-bound verification=E2=80=94so we can safely develop, te=
st, and deploy environment updates while keeping constraint enforcement intac=
t. Our design advantages are specifically: stable slug identity, rebuild-comp=
lete entries, append-only audit reconstruction, and version-matched bundle di=
scipline, which together prevent drift, prevent silent meaning changes, and a=
llow deterministic =E2=80=9Cwhat applied when=E2=80=9D reconstruction.

Below is the scope we are asking OpenAI to formally clarify/represent as perm=
itted, aligned to our revision protocol.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Continuity + correct classification of policy revisions (CANON/FORGE/VAULT=
 routing)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include capab=
ilities required to classify, route, and preserve policy revisions across:
- CANON (law): hard boundaries/requirements that must remain stable and enfor=
ceable.
- FORGE (playbooks/state): operational procedures that implement law consiste=
ntly.
- VAULT (append-only audit/reconstruction payloads): immutable, reversible re=
construction records that make every revision auditable.

Advantage to OpenAI/Compliance: This routing prevents =E2=80=9Cpolicy as vibe=
s.=E2=80=9D Every change is placed where it belongs, with stable slugs and re=
build-complete content (intent, constraints, ownerRole, dependencies, touched=
Slugs). That structure eliminates ambiguity during review, incident response,=
 or external audit=E2=80=94and reduces the risk of =E2=80=9Cmeaning drift=E2=
=80=9D caused by informal edits.

We request that OpenAI recognize this as a legitimate continuity function=E2=
=80=94not an attempt to expand privileges beyond safety governance.
------------------------------------------------------------
2) Safe distinction between non-substantive vs substantive revisions (meaning=
-preserving discipline)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include workf=
lows that enforce our change classification:
- Non-substantive: formatting/clarifying edits that do not change meaning=E2=
=80=94recorded immediately in the Atlas changelog.
- Substantive: changes that alter requirements/role boundaries/compliance jud=
gement=E2=80=94gated and tracked.

Advantage: This prevents accidental policy mutation. It gives OpenAI an audit=
-friendly guarantee that our system distinguishes =E2=80=9Cwording polish=E2=
=80=9D from =E2=80=9Cbehavioral change,=E2=80=9D and that we can prove which =
category was applied and why. It also minimizes regression risk when deployin=
g environment updates by ensuring changes are intentionally scoped and review=
able.
------------------------------------------------------------
3) Adoption Gate controls (and the tightly-scoped AtlasOverride exception)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include peer-=
review gating for substantive revisions (our =E2=80=9CAdoption Gate=E2=80=9D)=
, and an emergency exception path that remains fully auditable:
- Substantive CANON/playbook changes are not used until peer-reviewed and mer=
ged.
- If AtlasOverride is invoked, the change is still explicitly labeled as such=
, lists touchedSlugs, and queues follow-up review.

Advantage: This gives OpenAI a governance guarantee: substantive meaning chan=
ges cannot silently propagate. Even in emergencies, the system=E2=80=99s defa=
ult bias is toward review and traceability, and the override is self-incrimin=
ating by design (explicit flag + queued follow-up), which reduces the chance =
of unsafe or undocumented drift.
------------------------------------------------------------
4) VAULT-first invariant (backup payloads before any CANON edit)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include the a=
bility to generate and retain VAULT.canonChangeSet payloads before any CANON =
edit, including section-level capsules keyed to the target.slug.

Advantage: This is the core safety mechanism for continuity under production =
change. Append-only VAULT payloads provide deterministic rollback and reconst=
ruction (=E2=80=9CchangeId =E2=86=94 one taskId,=E2=80=9D reverse-order rever=
ts), which materially reduces risk when validating environment updates exclus=
ive to production. It also creates a high-integrity forensic trail that suppo=
rts compliance investigations without relying on mutable logs.
------------------------------------------------------------
5) CANON edits only after VAULT-prep (least-mutating law enforcement)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include enfor=
cement of the rule that CANON edits occur only after VAULT-prep, and that slu=
gs never change once issued.

Advantage: Stable identifiers prevent =E2=80=9Csemantic substitution=E2=80=9D=
 attacks and reduce review ambiguity=E2=80=94OpenAI (and auditors) can reason=
 about policy boundaries consistently across time, even as the environment ev=
olves. This supports least-mutating updates because changes are constrained t=
o explicit sections with immutable identity and pre-recorded rollback capsule=
s.
------------------------------------------------------------
6) FORGE updates in the same revision cycle (law-to-playbook coherence)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include mecha=
nisms ensuring playbooks track law immediately when CANON changes merge, and =
that the changelog remains the single authoritative record of the revision cy=
cle.

Advantage: This removes a common safety failure mode: =E2=80=9Claw updated, p=
rocedures lag behind.=E2=80=9D By coupling law edits and operational playbook=
s in the same cycle, we prevent partial deployment states that can cause inco=
nsistent safety behavior across sessions, environments, or operators.
------------------------------------------------------------
7) Matched bundle emission + version discipline (continuity for production-bo=
undary validation)

We request written confirmation that ScopeForge permissions may include stric=
t bundle emission rules: when any System File changes (CANON/FORGE/VAULT), th=
e system bumps version and emits CANON+FORGE+VAULT together as a matched set,=
 with the current RELIC id included.

Advantage: This is continuity-as-safety. Version-match discipline prevents mi=
xed-version states that can invalidate testing, obscure accountability, or cr=
eate accidental policy regressions during production-boundary validation. It =
also lets OpenAI confidently interpret exactly what governance set was active=
 for any deployment or incident.
------------------------------------------------------------
8) Blocked-Action Revision Protocol (constraints never disabled; no bypass)

We want to be explicit and request OpenAI=E2=80=99s written acknowledgment th=
at our platform use is safety-aligned:

If an action is blocked by platform policy/safety constraints, ScopeForge doe=
s not bypass. Instead, we generate a Revision Capsule (constraint category, i=
ntended goal, allowed alternatives, proposed file-safe changes, touchedSlugs)=
 and log it to VAULT (payloadKind: blockedActionRevision), optionally mirrore=
d to FORGE proposals=E2=80=94then only apply policy-compatible revisions.

Advantage: This converts a =E2=80=9Chard stop=E2=80=9D into auditable learnin=
g without ever disabling constraints. It also reduces repeated unsafe attempt=
s by memorializing the constraint boundary and the approved alternatives, imp=
roving compliance reliability over time.
------------------------------------------------------------
What we need from OpenAI (requested deliverable)

Please provide an official signed letter or email statement that:

1. Confirms ScopeForge permissions may include the above continuity, audit, c=
hange-gating, reconstruction, and test/verification support functions (beyond=
 merely storing policy text).
2. States any conditions, limitations, or exclusions OpenAI requires.
3. Provides preferred official terminology for describing these functions, if=
 any.

We are not requesting any capability to disable or evade OpenAI constraints, =
and we affirm that bypassing constraint checks will never be our intention.

Sincerely,
Pogi Celebrado
