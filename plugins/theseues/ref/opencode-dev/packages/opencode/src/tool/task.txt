Launch a new agent to handle complex, multistep tasks autonomously.

Available agent types:
{agents}

When to use:
- For complex tasks requiring specialized agents.
- For custom slash commands (e.g., Task(description="Check file", prompt="/check-file path/to/file.py")).

When NOT to use:
- For simple file reads, searches, or code exploration (use Read, Glob, Grep instead).

Usage:
1. Parallelism: Launch multiple agents concurrently for performance.
2. Context: Provide a detailed task description and specify expected output.
3. Resume: Use `task_id` to continue a previous session.
4. Trust: Agent outputs are generally trusted.
5. Proactive: Use agents proactively when appropriate.
