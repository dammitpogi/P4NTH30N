H4NDv2 VM Deployment completed after seven obstacles each resolved through iterative debugging and code changes. Chrome CDP binding to localhost required netsh portproxy to forward 192.168.56.1:9222 to 127.0.0.1:9222. WebSocket URL rewriting in CdpClient.FetchDebuggerUrlAsync replaced localhost with configured HostIp. Event message interleaving in SendCommandAsync fixed by looping until matching command id found. MongoDB replica set discovery issue resolved with directConnection=true query parameter. Environment variable precedence meant P4NTHE0N_MONGODB_URI without directConnection overrode mongodb.uri file. Single file publish caused AppContext.BaseDirectory to resolve to temp extraction directory so switched to non single file publish. PowerShell variable escaping through Invoke-Command required batch files for reliable execution.

Final state shows H4ND running in VM at 192.168.56.10 connected to host MongoDB at 192.168.56.1:27017 with directConnection=true and host Chrome CDP at 192.168.56.1:9222 via portproxy. H4ND processes signals from SIGN4L collection and executes CDP flows. Login failures expected as Chrome not navigated to actual game pages.

Code changes persisted in MongoConnectionOptions.cs with mongodb.uri file override and env var check, CdpClient.cs with WebSocket URL rewriting and command ID matching for event handling. All 88 unit tests passed including 4 CircuitBreaker tests, 15 DPD Calculator tests, 13 SignalService tests, 29 Idempotent Signal Generation tests, 16 Pipeline Integration tests, 9 EncryptionService tests, and 2 ForecastingService tests.

DECISION_OPS_004 completed with MongoDB env var updated to include directConnection=true. DECISION_OPS_005 through OPS_008 proposed for end to end spin verification, failure recovery verification, temp script cleanup, and DLQ discrepancy resolution.
