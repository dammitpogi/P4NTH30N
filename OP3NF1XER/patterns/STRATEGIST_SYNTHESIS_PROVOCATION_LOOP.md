# Pattern: Strategist Synthesis Provocation Loop

Decision link: `DECISION_135`

## Trigger

When Nexus requests stronger synthesis quality, richer journals, or provocative narrative output.

## Mandatory Sequence

1. Extract narrative anchors from manifest (`tone`, `theme`, `keyMoment`, `emotion`, metrics).
2. Build narrative spine (`pressure`, `fracture`, `pivot`, `consequence`, `vector`).
3. Produce journal first, speech second.
4. Enforce fidelity floor (no invented facts, no invented metrics).
5. Run synthesis audit checks before marking synthesized.

## Closure Rule

Do not close if narrative intensity is high but evidence traceability is weak.
