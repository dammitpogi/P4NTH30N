# Pattern: Strategist Beast-Mode Hardening Loop

Decision link: `DECISION_134`

## Trigger

When Nexus requests strategist expansion for high-variance governance, external codebase inspection, or stronger auditability.

## Mandatory Sequence

1. Define deterministic strategist phases: `Intake -> Frame -> Consult -> Synthesize -> Contract -> Audit -> Learn`.
2. Add explicit external-audit mode for peer-maintained codebases.
3. Enforce evidence contract (`facts`, `assumptions`, `open questions`, `validation commands`, `closure evidence`).
4. Set efficiency caps (bounded consultation rounds, decision skeleton first).
5. Add self-maintenance retrospective and automation-promotion rule.

## Closure Rule

Do not close until strategist source-of-truth policy and decision-engine memory docs both reflect the hardening deltas.
