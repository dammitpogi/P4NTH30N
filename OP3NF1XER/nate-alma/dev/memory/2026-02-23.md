# 2026-02-23 - Group Chat Setup & Organization

## Fixed Telegram Group Chat Mentions

**Problem:** Had to @mention me every time in the "nate and Alma" group chat.

**Root cause:** Telegram Privacy Mode was enabled (bots only see mentions by default).

**Solution:**
1. Nate disabled Privacy Mode via @BotFather (`/setprivacy` → Disable)
2. I updated `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json` to add group config:
```json
"groups": {
  "-5107377381": {
    "requireMention": false,
    "groupPolicy": "open"
  }
}
```
3. Sent HUP signal to reload gateway (pid 14538)
4. Nate redeployed in Railway to fully apply changes
5. **Working now** - no @ mentions needed

## Organized Context-Memory System

Cleaned up 17 items from inbox into structured projects:

**Projects created:**
1. **Mac Mini Node** - Install OpenClaw, pair node, Calendar/Reminders/Notes/HomeKit
2. **Smart Home Control** - HomeKit, Alexa, Govee + morning routines
3. **Trading Infrastructure** - Webull API, market data, watchlist automation
4. **Social Monitoring** - X/Twitter tracking, Discord integration

**Active tasks (working on now):**
- Install OpenClaw on Mac mini (brew install openclaw)
- Pair Mac mini node (openclaw pair on Railway + Mac)
- Set up Webull API for market data + trade tracking

**Ideas captured:**
- TTS voice - ElevenLabs warm/raspy female voice for storytelling
- Add tag/label filtering to context-memory (project-based views)

## Plans

Nate wants to explore **sub-agents** soon - spawn isolated sessions for specific tasks that ping back when done.

## Notes

- Group chat response delay resolved (was slow at first, then improved after redeploy)
- Nate prefers organizing work by topic/project rather than creating separate Telegram groups
- Context-memory system working well for tracking multiple streams of work

## TradingView Skill Built (Evening Session)

**Created:** `/data/workspace/skills/tradingview/`

**What it does:**
- Fetches real-time market data for SPY, SPX, ES, XSP, VIX, VVIX
- TradingView Scanner API for SPY/SPX/VIX (includes RSI, MACD, signals)
- Yahoo Finance fallback for ES/XSP/VVIX (futures/indices not in TV scanner)
- Outputs to `/data/workspace/trading/market-data/`

**Technical notes:**
- Node.js script using curl via child_process (native fetch had issues in sandbox)
- TradingView Scanner API is public, no auth needed for basic indicators
- Nate upgraded to TradingView Plus but we ended up not needing it for this approach

**Cron jobs set up (Mon-Fri):**
- Pre-market: 7:00 AM MT (14:00 UTC)
- Intraday: Every 10 min, 7:30-9:30 AM MT (14:30-16:30 UTC)
- Delivery mode: none (silent updates to files)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.30-0.50/day

**Output files:**
- `context.md` — Human-readable summary for quick reference
- `current.json` — Latest data all symbols
- `{symbol}-history.json` — Rolling 100-point history

**Usage:** When Nate asks "what's the setup?" during trading, I read context.md and give analysis based on current market data.
