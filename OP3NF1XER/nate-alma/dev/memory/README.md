# Memory

Long-term, curated knowledge. Stuff worth keeping.

Directory layout in this deployment:

- `memory/p4nthe0n-openfixer/` - OpenFixer prompt packet and handoff narratives
- `memory/decision-engine/` - decision provenance mirrors and playbooks
- `memory/alma-teachings/` - doctrine + textbook artifacts
- `.backups/` - local backup artifacts and restore payloads (deployment-side)

- **YYYY-MM-DD.md** — Daily journals (raw notes)
- **projects.md** — Active projects & status
- **lessons.md** — Things learned
- **people.md** — People & relationships
- **decisions.md** — Important decisions made
- **goals.md** — Long-term goals

Review periodically and migrate important daily notes here.

Do not store secrets in memory files. Use workspace auth vault paths under `skills/auth-vault/` + `.secrets/`.
