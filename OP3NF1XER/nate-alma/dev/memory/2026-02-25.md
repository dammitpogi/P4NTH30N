----- BEGIN SOURCE_A -----
Pantheon introduction pass completed for OpenClaw memory continuity. Added OpenFixer narrative packet and codemap references, assimilated DECISION_136 and DECISION_137 into operator-facing guidance, and introduced deterministic Anthropic model-switch tooling with enforced pre-audit and post-audit evidence requirements.

Deployment continuity now includes successful Railway deploy id ce66f121-4a0a-424b-aa25-ef150c1a6b60, healthy /healthz signal, and auth-gated control routes. Textbook content verification remains gated behind setup auth and should be verified with valid credentials during next authenticated endpoint probe pass.

Reviewed Nate-agent chat memory requests (group mention policy, model fallback/routing, sub-agent exploration, and storytelling delivery) and added `nate-agent-ops-kit` plus local `sag` tool so these recurring asks are executable as deterministic tools instead of ad-hoc instructions.

Restore-mode continuation: merged deployment runtime AGENTS guardrails into workspace AGENTS without removing soul directives, validated Railway deployment `3206cdc5-b7ba-4d19-a77a-c686a3530c5c` as `SUCCESS`, and verified gateway token path (`gateway.auth.mode=token`, `gateway.remote.token` present). Current incident class is Control UI client token state drift (1008 unauthorized), not service-down runtime.
