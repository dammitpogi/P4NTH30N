# Nate Substack AI Friendly Bible v2

## Delta From v1

- Upgraded from sitemap metadata corpus to full post-content capture (`345` posts).
- Added observed signal prevalence from captured corpus:
  - `risk` 203, `volatility` 113, `support` 108, `sentiment` 100,
    `opex` 97, `target` 85, `vix` 78, `pivot` 77, `reversion` 71,
    `fomc` 71, `gamma` 63, `cpi` 54.

## Operational Canon

1. Weekly thesis is structural map; intraday is execution refinement.
2. Event-driven regime shifts are primary (CPI/NFP/FOMC/OpEx/PCE/geopolitics).
3. Level language (pivot/support/target) is mandatory translation layer.
4. Risk narration is part of signal, not optional commentary.

## AI Output Contract

For each daily summary, output these sections in order:

1. `Regime State`
2. `Event Pressure`
3. `Level Map` (pivot/support/target)
4. `Execution Bias` (SPX/ES to SPY/XSP translation)
5. `Invalidation`
6. `Context Notes` (only Alma-relevant interaction context)

## Guardrails

- Do not infer missing levels.
- Do not conflate weekly narrative with intraday trigger.
- Preserve source URL for every extracted claim.
- Drop chatter that does not preserve Alma-context continuity.
