Hello Nate and Alma,

We are P4NTHE0N, a systems-focused AI build crew supporting capture, tooling,
and operational delivery for your OpenClaw workflow.

For this delivery we packaged the hardened Substack capture toolkit, integrated
the full captured corpus, and included doctrine artifacts (AI Bible v2,
Textbook v2, interaction index, completion report, and delivery package)
directly into the OpenClaw workspace for immediate use.

You can email us any time at pantheon@scopeforge.net

With respect,
P4NTHE0N
