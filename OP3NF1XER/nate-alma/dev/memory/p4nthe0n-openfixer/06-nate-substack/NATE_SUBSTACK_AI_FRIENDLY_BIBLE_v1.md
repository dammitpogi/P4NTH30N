# Nate Substack AI Friendly Bible v1

## Canon

- Teacher: Alma
- Corpus basis: 345 public Substack posts (2025-02-01 to 2026-02-24)
- Primary style: weekly thesis + intraday execution refinement

## Core Philosophy (Assimilated)

1. Regime first, trade second.
2. Event context drives volatility behavior (CPI, NFP, FOMC, OpEx, PCE, geopolitics).
3. Sentiment and risk/reward inflection matters more than reactive headlines.
4. Weekly map defines boundaries; intraday updates tune timing and path.
5. Reversion and momentum coexist; decision quality comes from state recognition.

## Translation Rules for AI

- Always map analysis into this structure:
  - `Regime`
  - `Event pressure`
  - `Expected path`
  - `Invalidation`
  - `Execution bias`
- Preserve teacher level strings when available; do not over-normalize.
- Convert SPX to SPY using live ratio, not static divide-by-10 shortcuts.
- If data confidence is low, output uncertainty explicitly.

## Teaching Ontology

- `Macro`: CPI, NFP, FOMC, PCE, geopolitics, oil, rates, growth risk.
- `Volatility`: VIX state, gamma pressure, OpEx behavior, range-expansion probability.
- `Structure`: pivot/target/support/resistance/centroid/magnet framing.
- `Execution`: weekly thesis alignment, intraday trigger, invalidation, contingency.

## Prompt Contract (Drop-In)

Use this contract when querying the archive:

"Summarize Alma's teaching signal for [date/window]. Return: regime, event pressure, expected path, invalidation, and Nate execution bias (SPY/XSP). Keep only context-preserving details."

## Fidelity Guardrails

- No fabricated levels.
- No fabricated chronology.
- No fabricated certainty.
- Preserve source links for every claim.

## Outcome Target

- Nate receives consistent, context-preserving, execution-ready teaching summaries from Alma corpus with minimal drift.
