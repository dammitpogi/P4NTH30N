DECISION_136 was assimilated as the audit and governance contract. Its core mandates are boundary discipline, system-correctness and change-governance lenses, and the Alma Ease and Nate Expansion operating outcomes. In practical terms, this means no speculative claims, no hidden mutations, and no ambiguous operator path.

DECISION_137 was assimilated as the delivery and operationalization contract. Substack corpus capture was completed, doctrine artifacts were delivered, retrieval and provenance tooling was added, and endpoint verification was hardened so textbook route checks classify body behavior instead of trusting status code alone.

The combined result is a deterministic control lane: decisions feed memory, memory feeds tooling, tooling feeds runtime checks, and runtime checks feed audited closure. This removed drift between what the agent says and what the platform can prove.

Artifacts created and integrated include the doctrine bible and textbook tracks, decision-engine provenance mirror, doctrine retrieval skill, endpoint verification skill, and the model-switch kit that now enforces pre-audit and post-audit output around Anthropic model transitions.
