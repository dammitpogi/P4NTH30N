OpenFixer handoff to Nate's Agent. This message is intentionally compact for chat limits. If your platform has strict message size, paste this in two parts and acknowledge constraints before execution.

Operate in one pass, no question loops, evidence first. Use Pantheon continuity with provenance from these paths: C:/P4NTH30N/codemap.md, C:/P4NTH30N/STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/DECISION_136_OPENCLAW_EXTERNAL_CODEBASE_AUDIT_KICKOFF.md, C:/P4NTH30N/STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/DECISION_137_NATE_SUBSTACK_TEACHINGS_CAPTURE_AND_SEARCH.md, C:/P4NTH30N/STR4TEG15T/memory/decision-engine/OPENCLAW_EXTERNAL_AUDIT_PLAYBOOK_v1.md, C:/P4NTH30N/OP3NF1XER/deployments/JOURNAL_2026-02-25_DECISION_136_137_ASSIMILATION_MODEL_SWITCH.md.

Current deployment truth to verify and report with raw output: Railway latest deployment id 125ffcd1-5639-402e-8606-6972dd21e3b9 is SUCCESS, /healthz is 200, and /, /openclaw, /setup/export, /textbook are auth-gated 401 without setup credentials.

Run and report evidence for these checks: railway status --json, python skills/openclaw-endpoint-kit/scripts/endpoint_probe.py --base "https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app", python skills/openclaw-model-switch-kit/scripts/switch_anthropic_model.py --help, python skills/nate-agent-ops-kit/scripts/extract_requests.py, python skills/nate-agent-ops-kit/scripts/apply_nate_baseline.py --help, python skills/nate-agent-ops-kit/scripts/workflow_runner.py --help, python skills/auth-vault/scripts/vault.py --help, python skills/anthropic-usage/scripts/check_usage.py --help, python skills/sag/scripts/sag.py --help, python skills/sag/scripts/sag.py "Pantheon audit voice check".

Run preview-only audits (no mutation): python skills/openclaw-model-switch-kit/scripts/switch_anthropic_model.py --target sonnet and python skills/nate-agent-ops-kit/scripts/apply_nate_baseline.py --group-id -5107377381. Do not claim model switching unless PRE-AUDIT, MUTATION REPORT, POST-AUDIT, and restart/status proof are all present.

Validate secrets and OAuth path through auth-vault only. Do not store secrets in memory files. Validate auth-vault list and oauth-refresh command readiness. For Linux, report keyring backend status explicitly; if unavailable, report secure fallback policy and do not use plaintext unless explicitly approved.

Run anthropic usage probe: python skills/anthropic-usage/scripts/check_usage.py. If ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is missing, report BLOCKED with remediation command and still mark structural readiness PASS.

Run reusable profile check: python skills/nate-agent-ops-kit/scripts/workflow_runner.py --profile heartbeat --group-id -5107377381.

Final output format is required: a PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL matrix for deployment status, endpoint health, route auth posture, model-switch readiness, Nate ops toolkit readiness, auth-vault readiness, OAuth refresh readiness, anthropic usage readiness, heartbeat quality, AGENTS hardening without soul loss, TOOLS secret hygiene, and unresolved blockers. If any line is PARTIAL/FAIL, self-heal where possible, rerun affected checks, and append re-audit matrix.

Before doing any requested work, post one short acknowledgement in chat: "I see the chat-size constraint and will keep responses chunk-safe while preserving full audit evidence."
