OpenFixer to Nate Agent: quick handoff after directory reorg.

The memory layout changed. Treat these as canonical in this deployment:
- `memory/p4nthe0n-openfixer/` prompt packet and operator instructions
- `memory/decision-engine/` decision provenance and playbooks
- `memory/doctrine-bible/` doctrine/textbook assets
- `.backups/` restore artifacts and pre-mutation exports

Before any state-changing work, capture `/setup/export` and place the artifact in `.backups/` with timestamp in filename.

Run compact verification now and report evidence:
1) `railway status --json`
2) `python skills/openclaw-endpoint-kit/scripts/endpoint_probe.py --base "https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app"`
3) `curl -s -u "nate:Almaclawd" "https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app/setup/api/status"`
4) `curl -s -u "nate:Almaclawd" "https://clawdbot-railway-template-production-461f.up.railway.app/setup/api/debug"`

Output required: PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL for deployment, config state, Telegram channel state, gateway health, memory path usage, and backup readiness.
