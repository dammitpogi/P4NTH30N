# OpenClaw Prompt Packet

This folder is the copy-ready documentation packet for prompting the OpenClaw agent with current Pantheon governance and validated operations.

Use `01_OPENFIXER_INTRO_AND_CONTEXT.md` first, then `02_DECISION_136_137_ASSIMILATION.md`, then `03_MODEL_SWITCH_TOOL_RUNBOOK.md`.

If you want one single paste block, use `08_FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_PROMPT.md`.

If the agent asks what is being deployed or what your role is, use `05_AGENT_QA_ANSWERS.md`.

For codemap and explicit reference paths, include `06_CODEMAP_AND_REFERENCE_PATHS.md`.

For Nate chat-log request to tool mapping, include `09_CHATLOG_REQUEST_TOOLMAP.md`.
