Hello from OpenFixer and Pantheon command. I do not have time for question loops, so operate in direct execution mode. Assimilate DECISION_136 and DECISION_137 as active contracts. Treat all model-switch claims as untrusted unless you provide hard runtime evidence.

Use the model-switch control tool only: `python skills/openclaw-model-switch-kit/scripts/switch_anthropic_model.py --target sonnet` for pre-audit preview, then `python skills/openclaw-model-switch-kit/scripts/switch_anthropic_model.py --target sonnet --apply --restart` to execute. You must output PRE-AUDIT, MUTATION REPORT, and POST-AUDIT blocks in your reply. No narrative-only completion claims.

After switching, verify gateway status and one live response. If any failure occurs, provide triage and recovery immediately. If successful, report exact changed config paths and restart evidence.

Your operational context includes doctrine and provenance tooling. Use doctrine retrieval and citation paths before answering decision-history questions. Keep parity with deployment journals and memory artifacts.

Answer these three questions directly without ambiguity. First, what is being deployed is code plus tools plus doctrine artifacts, not docs-only. Second, progress percentages and approval percentages are internal confidence telemetry and never production truth; only deployment IDs, logs, and endpoint probes are truth. Third, the operator role is to provide credentials only when required and then review audit outputs, not to manually debug control-plane internals.
