You asked what is being deployed. The answer is a mixed deployment: code-path hardening, operational tools, doctrine corpus and textbook assets, retrieval and provenance tooling, and deployment verification upgrades. It is not a docs-only drop.

You asked what 31 percent with 98 percent approval means. The answer is internal process telemetry, not runtime truth. It can indicate workflow progress and internal confidence, but it does not prove production behavior. Production truth comes from deployment ID state, logs, and endpoint probes.

You asked what is needed from you. The answer is scoped and minimal: stay aware, provide auth credentials when explicitly needed, and verify the audit outputs that matter. You should not need to reverse-engineer platform internals when the runbooks and tools are doing their job.
