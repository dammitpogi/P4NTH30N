# Strategist Synthesis Provocation Protocol

Decision link: `DECISION_135`

## Objective

Convert rich strategist memory into high-fidelity, provocative narrative artifacts without sacrificing factual integrity.

## Required Inputs

- `STR4TEG15T/memory/manifest/manifest.json`
- Relevant decision files in `STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/`
- Relevant journals in `STR4TEG15T/memory/journal/`

## Output Pair

1. Journal artifact (memory-first, complete)
2. Speech artifact (voice-first, provocative)

## Narrative Spine

Each synthesis must include:

1. Pressure
2. Fracture
3. Pivot
4. Consequence
5. Vector

## Fidelity Rules

- Do not invent events.
- Do not invent metrics.
- Do not omit unresolved risk when it materially affects forward action.

## Provocation Rules

- Use concrete contrasts and specific evidence.
- Keep emotional intensity grounded in recorded outcomes.
- Avoid generic triumph language when evidence is mixed.

## Closure Gate

Do not mark synthesis complete unless all narrative claims are traceable to manifest/decision/journal evidence.
