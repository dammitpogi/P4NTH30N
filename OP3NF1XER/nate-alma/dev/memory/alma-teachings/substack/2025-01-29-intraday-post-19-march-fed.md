Market analysisIntraday post 19/march (+Fed)...quick macroMar 19, 2025162ShareI can’t stress this enough—whether in my daily chat (in my first messages) or in my posts—that the U.S. is struggling with stagflation. Trump has set out to eradicate this stagflation from the economy, even if only on paper. Last year was about two things: 1) Trump winning the election, and 2) figuring out when the Fed would cut rates. That’s why we saw the July–August vol squeeze, to give some room for the Fed. As I emphasized, the cut was a “hawkish cut,” purely for populist reasons, and—as anticipated—inflationary pressure continued to rise. I kept showing this on Twitter, shorted the market, and voilà, I was right again…Inflation did not moderate last year; in fact, it only grew. The economy needs room so that the U.S. can achieve sustained, long-term, stable growth. That’s what you need to understand. This is why everything you see happening is happening: the negative wealth effect. Leverage flush. Wall Street is reporting huge losses (even the renowned Renaissance), while dealer desks (like Citadel’s MM department) are booking profits. They’ll cover their losses during tax-harvesting time.Now, listen,Over the past three years, the Fed has been allowing a set amount of its bond holdings to mature without reinvesting the proceeds. This “runoff” drains reserves from the banking system—a process the Fed has used to gradually tighten monetary policy. In 2019, a similar reduction led to strains in overnight funding markets, forcing the Fed to reverse course.Now, with the looming need for Congress to raise the debt ceiling, there’s a risk that Treasury actions (like drawing down its general account to conserve cash) will distort reserve levels. If the Treasury’s cash is rebuilt quickly once the debt ceiling is extended, it could cause a rapid exit of reserves from the system. To avoid a potential liquidity crunch in the overnight markets (the “altimeter” of the financial system), Fed officials are considering a tactical pause or slowdown in the balance-sheet runoff. This would help ensure that reserves aren’t drained too quickly during a period when market signals might be misleading because of the interplay between the Fed’s operations and debt ceiling dynamics. This pause wouldn’t indicate a change in the Fed’s overall goal of reducing its balance sheet—it would simply delay the process until after the debt ceiling issues are resolved and Treasury cash balances stabilize.The SPX/long-term yields correlation has risen 62.3 basis points since last Monday and is currently trending at 54%. So this doesn’t just mean that good news is good news; it also means no news is good news, because investors see a pause in the runoff as reducing the risk of an abrupt reserve drain. In the short term, that’s supportive. Remember, based on the faked CPI and other reports, inflationary pressure appears to have eased.Let’s see what the market is telling us… INTRADAYKeep my weekly post in mind…Strong futs overnight.The models show that since last Wednesday, the market has been oscillating intraday (just as I predicted it would) with a slight neutral-to-positive drift and relatively low variance. However, the ADF test still does not indicate any tendency toward a mean-reverting phase in the broader momentum. That said, the reversion model shows a 97.62% probability of reversion, but I want to emphasize again that, on a longer timeframe, the market’s momentum does not suggest a shift toward a mean-reverting phase. So this signal is more of a supportive signal rather than a strictly reversion one. Intraday, however, the oscillation is very strong. According to the model, as long as the SPX can hold the 5523.5 level, the positive drift remains intact.As I mentioned, funds are in mean reversion mode during RTH (regular trading hours). This means that whatever they do during the Asian and London sessions, they reverse during RTH, causing oscillations.Yesterday, however, the VIX options technically expired, and the beta hedging trades in ES put pressure on the index, as the VIX was pinned around 21.Let’s take a look at the skew. Here, you can see today’s 5-delta put – 5-delta call range: If we measure the skew slope for the 25d Put/ATM, 25d Call/ATM, and 25d Put/25d Call segments, we can observe that since yesterday, the slope has decreased slightly. However, compared to one week ago, there is a 3.51% increase in the longer skew. But if we look at the ATM vs. call and ATM vs put segments, we see that it’s not demand for puts that has grown; rather, demand for calls has fallen.Compared to the values from February 24, the slope has decreased by 8.84%, which indicates a shorter skew—and indeed, it stems from the put side.The VIX is quite similar enough.At the same time, we’re seeing a moderate increase on the tail-put side (and on tail-calls as well!). It’s not huge, but we need to pay attention because it affects the vol profile’s sensitivity. I code 5611.96 as our main pivot level, and 5523.77 (very close to the 5523.5 my momentum model highlighted—no coincidence!) as the point below which the trend turns decisively more bearish. That level should be taken very seriously today.There’s also something else: looking at the Friday AM expiration vol profile, the model gives 5622.03 as today’s pivot. 10 pts above the intraday vol profile based pivot. And we’re currently almost at their geometric midpoint (3 points below it). Not by coincidence. It’s a typical footprint of heavy algo trading.From the vol profile’s perspective, 5567.27 is another crucial level for the bulls—if puts don’t catch a bid there, the trend won’t start rolling downhill. If they stay calm in that zone, put decay will be supportive.For upward momentum, 5698.85 is the key level per the vol profile—it’s a trend-reversal threshold. But watch 5656.83 carefully, to see if calls catch a bid. That will be your signal of how strong the upside could be.OptionsDepth chart: (Description is here)Coding zero vanna at 5608 (high vol needed for break through).From positioning perspective the move can be stabilizied by MM flow above 5711We have a MM long fly patter with 5600 in the middle. Short speed below, long speed above.In theory, we should see increased spot/vol beta below 5535.52, and decreased spot vol beta above 5659.26, and ‘feel’ the longer gamma effect.This setup favors for vol increase in theory and wider rangebound. Below 5613 the charm flows turn positive (putting dealers in longer delta in every 5 mins, forcing them to sell futs).Color (charm convexity) is negative, meaning, the gamma decay is on, during the session, and this favors for more volatility. Any deviation from this exposes the underlying customer flow.SubscribeSCRIPT INPUTS:SPX99.73%, 5749.414878376666, , 5715.62691588033, 95.4%, 5682.0375173133325, Risk level, 5660.072497606687, 68.2%, 5648.248370493001, 68.2%, 5580.869796508938, Risk level, 5569.247814893313, 95.4%, 5547.2827951866675, , 5513.4911928797255, 99.73%, 5479.905434123334ES=F99.73%, 5755.927536872077, , 5721.341744375597, 95.4%, 5686.963768436039, Risk level, 5664.48157992589, 68.2%, 5652.3767081709675, 68.2%, 5583.411640648245, Risk level, 5571.51842007411, 95.4%, 5549.036231563961, , 5514.446540632414, 99.73%, 5480.072463127923SPY99.73%, 575.0362195916605, , 571.5214278523413, 95.4%, 568.0281195614552, Risk level, 565.7434789516084, 68.2%, 564.5131944699493, 68.2%, 557.5049577349258, Risk level, 556.2965601108916, 95.4%, 554.0119195010448, , 550.4967175192262, 99.73%, 547.0038194708395VIX99.73%, 24.938991438492593, , 24.115652875377815, 95.4%, 23.319496100716023, Risk level, 22.791540620600863, 68.2%, 22.495179109687065, 68.2%, 20.87455348136205, Risk level, 20.608460905278044, 95.4%, 20.080505425162883, , 19.253737642695445, 99.73%, 18.461010087386313IWM99.73%, 209.65748207791071, , 208.03936902893426, 95.4%, 206.43374439588894, Risk level, 205.38280591154987, 68.2%, 204.8155330648956, 68.2%, 201.59169395747077, Risk level, 201.0372075161845, 95.4%, 199.98626903184544, , 198.36785155340257, 99.73%, 196.76253134982366QQQ99.73%, 489.6088161899683, , 485.82700867150174, 95.4%, 482.0744123674451, Risk level, 479.6181967213025, 68.2%, 478.2923747710553, 68.2%, 470.7577335057741, Risk level, 469.4618203685412, 95.4%, 467.00560472239863, , 463.22308451627606, 99.73%, 459.47120089987544NQ=F99.73%, 20108.010190567282, , 19954.61001256226, 95.4%, 19802.38009528364, Risk level, 19702.744684221172, 68.2%, 19648.970815865174, 68.2%, 19343.331331554, Risk level, 19290.755315778828, 95.4%, 19191.11990471636, , 19037.691545776295, 99.73%, 18885.489809432718NVDA99.73%, 123.44986157923175, , 121.42834488638991, 95.4%, 119.43993094220376, Risk level, 118.13269355453264, 68.2%, 117.41784900562926, 68.2%, 113.40731314953639, Risk level, 112.72730705581893, 95.4%, 111.4200696681478, , 109.39673292156769, 99.73%, 107.41013903111981AMZN99.73%, 201.731457287338, , 199.4911551058629, 95.4%, 197.27573230577838, Risk level, 195.82316596178993, 68.2%, 195.03514593039586, 68.2%, 190.57912346564285, Risk level, 189.81684868664757, 95.4%, 188.36428234265912, , 186.1230867571169, 99.73%, 183.9085573610995GOOG99.73%, 169.25619636815517, , 167.6015590057353, 95.4%, 165.96309726855023, Risk level, 164.88954696207904, 68.2%, 164.30829780868513, 68.2%, 161.0150299809983, Risk level, 160.4504493758116, 95.4%, 159.3768990693404, , 157.72175510732706, 99.73%, 156.08379996973545TSLA99.73%, 247.6089304677592, , 241.96998777386054, 95.4%, 236.45946401317647, Risk level, 232.8247379489825, 68.2%, 230.81741974884648, 68.2%, 219.66453682875593, Risk level, 217.795257168205, 95.4%, 214.16053110401103, , 208.5112884841305, 99.73%, 203.0110646494283TSM99.73%, 182.75515685140388, , 180.3328153080076, 95.4%, 177.9425808671082, Risk level, 176.37368109622778, 68.2%, 175.51979915206917, 68.2%, 170.7067581763026, Risk level, 169.88632866939722, 95.4%, 168.3174288985168, , 165.8936902204296, 99.73%, 163.50485291422112AMD99.73%, 109.08523400477256, , 107.6824059044494, 95.4%, 106.29761807050151, Risk level, 105.38885527592916, 68.2%, 104.89455025669267, 68.2%, 102.10668151953156, Risk level, 101.63114899653178, 95.4%, 100.72238620195942, , 99.31879859071132, 99.73%, 97.93477026768838Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.16 Likes∙2 Restacks162SharePreviousNext
