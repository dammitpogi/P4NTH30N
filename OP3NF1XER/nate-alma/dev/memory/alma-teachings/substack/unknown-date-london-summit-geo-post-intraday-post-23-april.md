Market analysisLondon summit - geo post, Intraday post (23/April) Apr 23, 2025∙ Paid19ShareInvestors still don’t trust Trump, and momentum remains well inside the rangebound zone I marked. Yesterday, a flurry of TSLA calls boosted the tape and some manipulative trades tried to jack up sentiment on a few headlines—but remember: no real progress was made. If anything, things look worse. That random gap-up came out of nowhere; it won’t hold any weight until the SPX convincingly breaks out of its range, stabilizes, the VIX drops back below 20, and we see actual progession on the US/EU/CN front.Think macro for a second… global peace and prosperity come from cooperation and shared ideals, yet today’s West treats every interaction—trade, diplomacy—as a zero-sum game. Countries build financial, military, cultural, even physical walls, viewing interdependence and multilateral institutions as threats, not assets. This mindset accelerates arms races and raises the risk of outright war.The London summit is underway, but its status has been downgraded to lower-level officials after heavy hitters like Secretary of State Marco Rubio bowed out. There’s been no genuine cease-fire breakthrough—just a theater of unity. Behind closed doors, U.S. envoys will keep quietly negotiating with the Kremlin, and Trump will likely distance himself from the formal peace process. He will go to Middle-East mid-May. Very important event.Meanwhile, Russia is cranking up drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, seizing territory in Donetsk and pounding civilian infrastructure—proof that Moscow expects minimal pushback, especially as NATO splinters along ideological lines. All signs point to Trump quietly backing away; investors don’t believe he can rein in the globalist power structure. But remember, if he somehow did, nearly every U.S. tariff would be rolled back overnight.No meaningful deal is possible without concessions Ukraine and its European backers have already categorically rejected. The financial and military burden now falls heavily on EU members—Spain alone has committed €10.5 billion to meet NATO’s 2 percent-of-GDP defense benchmark, and Portugal is scrambling for fiscal wiggle room. That strain will soon become untenable.In truth, London’s gathering is little more than a showpiece masking a renewed great-power rivalry. It’s critical to follow today’s and this weekend’s developments in that broader context.
