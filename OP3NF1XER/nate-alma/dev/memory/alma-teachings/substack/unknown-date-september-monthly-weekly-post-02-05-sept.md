Market analysisSEPTEMBER - Monthly & Weekly post (02-05/Sept)PMI, NFP, FOMC, OpEx, Monthly and weekly exposuresSep 01, 2025∙ Paid301ShareAs you know, my risk target is the second half of September given the hawkish cut scenario on 17/Sept. The cut will unlock some of the MMF money, but it won’t provide instant support for the market. The guidance is expected to be hawkish, simply because it is based on labour market weakness and to keep the momentum in growth, rather than disinflation. However, as I keep explaining Trump decided to manage debt burden over inflation. Market knew that Trump’s term will be inflationary. When the derisking finally happens, I will buy the dip heavily for the long-run (into the next 2-3 years). Now, let’s look at what tone the monthly exposure sets for the shorter tenors, then I will scrutinize what is the market’s expectation for the next week. MONTHLY EXPOSURECoding monthly positioning: This is a net short delta, short vega, long theta positioning, withshort vomma, long veta, long vanna and short charm. So, the market is pricing in a leptokurtic, negatively skewed distribution. This means, vol is muted until OpEx, however it is weakening, and after that the short vomma will expand vol moves. The vanna profile is steeper to the downside below 6461.83, and we have a 6.39% increase in 5-delta put skew during the last week, and a 9.79% increase in the 22-delta skew! The volatility market prices a 143.86 pts range to the upside and a 208.97 range to the downside on a monthly basis. Based on volatility distribution, this takes me to the 6557.93 - 6604.11 range to the upside and to the 6251.27 - 6318.35 range to the downside. What does it all mean? Quantitatively first…Above 6469.51 the market will face more vol selling, with heavy pivot at 6505/6519.75, from where the position becomes steep right-tailish, but based on vol market, 6557.93 is the main target, however, because the exposure is short vomma, we have a margin of error of 6604.11 into the month end. Simultanously they hedge a heavy left-tail, but vacuum-down won’t take effect if 6214.22 is held, and based on vomma, market expects 6318.35 a primal downside target and 6251.27 as a margin of error. The interesting part is that this derived expected area has a geometric mean just 6.14 pts higher than the vol adjusted mean of my reversion algo at 6278.57However if volatility goes out of control and skew shows strenght at 6214.22, the vacuum-down effect of the left-tail comes, and can easily take the market down to 6067.08; here participants should realize there hedges heavily, if not, vanna shows 5870 as the max. This is a very heavy left-tail scenario, market doesn’t shows this much of fear right-now. Both tail-skew and 22d skew is up significantly due to the expected hawkish cut and repricing, but not that much. They don’t expect any extra malign surprise. For first, they expect vol supply until Sept OpEx. To grasp the monthly sentiment more nuanced, let’s look at the OpEx exposure too (vol adjusted): Gamma only: First thing we should recognize is that vanna is net positive while speed is net negative, but both exposures are relatively flat, and vomma remains bid in this tenor as well. This is because, even tho customers buy less downside gamma relative to upside gamma, the vol risk premium is higher on them. The tail-skew is up by 8.21% and the 22-delta skew by 18.06% in this tenor, during the past week. This is significant. This is like expecting to hit 6165.87 on a hawkish Fed guidance after the cut. They expect that the downside volatility would ignite in the 6322.39 - 6366.64 range, keep this in mind, when you hedge. This line will test the skew. And this is what the vomma is also showing us. To the upside, they expect a 6532.63 - 6566.64 range as max, with volatility suppressed to 8.25% (currently at 9.46%). The monthly betSo, on a monthly basis, the participants are pricing a negative skewed distribution, with increasing kurtosis. We have a small right-tail, but an even fatter left-tail, especially into FOMC due to volatility.What market expects is, that volatility remains supplied/stairstep up, but this dampening effect is fading into the OpEx week, until they expect the market to range (follow weekly posts) in an expanded range, then they expect volatility squeeze on FOMC (similarly to 2024 Dec FOMC), then OpEx will provide some slowdown/downside support (due to the negative speed profile), Monday some delta buyback, and then further sell-off, but on a slowed manner, and Trump is expected to bail out the sentiment.The pivotal tenor for volatility is this coming week, where market prices a platykurtic, positively skewed distribution.  The reversion model shows probability for reversion around 84.15%, this is significant, and not unexpected after the 91.27% signal on 13/Aug, where I also warned, that during three times in the past (2018; 2021 and 2024) this high signal occured 1-month before the momentum shift, or 90 pts before the high (2024 July gamma squeeze).  Adjust your put spreads and put flies accordingly.The downside target that it says is 6278.57 - as mentioned above: In order to keep the positive imbalance, market should produce a 6450.61 monthly avg price, otherwise it goes toward equilibrium. Not a coincidence that the body of the distribution is there.As you know, I’m bullish for Trump term as dollar is crushed and market is heavily stimulated and Trump is about to manage debt burden over inflation. When the pullback happens and derisks the market, I will buy the dip heavily.Keep this post in mind: Playing the AI-Bubble; Long-term outlook Alma·July 22, 2025Read full storyStochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.
