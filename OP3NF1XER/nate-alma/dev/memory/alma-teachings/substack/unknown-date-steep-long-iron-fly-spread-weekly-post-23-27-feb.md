Market analysisSteep long iron fly spread | Weekly post (23-27/Feb) Tariffs, Iran, post-OpExFeb 22, 2026∙ Paid18SharePython quant course is already available on my Substack-site, by an ex-Wall Street quant.Few times ago, a high significance red-dot appeared on my famous reversion model on the longer time-frame. In this post below, I investigated and explained the reasons: The challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5Read full storyAnd a free post where I covered institutional flows, ERs, general sentiment and macro context: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026Alma·Jan 23Read full storyMarket stateLiquidity is very thin, and - as prewarned you in November, December - market is mostly running on passive flows and reallocation, and dispersion is very high. This is why, the it is not visible directly in the index. The rotation is concentrated mostly in NDX. As the first cracks of the bubble are already visible, trust in capex spending decreases, tech is up on speculative flows only. Free research-post about it soon.CTA, VC positionins remain asymmtric to the downside, but market is ready to swallow the momentums, as you will see below. Geo risk is still there, Iran tension will grow. Key date to watch on the short-run is Feb 26, when the negotiations continues in Genf. The market is buying calls on oil, and heavily hedging higher risk premium, as Iran-risk spikes, but I don’t expect any serious worsening until March OpEx week. That week is more risky. I don’t see this conflict to be solved any other way than military conflict. As much as I can tell, it is inevitable. Russia, China and Iran are only playing for time. Because, time is against Trump.Trump tariffsThe Supreme Court’s decision did not address the practical consequences of the tariffs, it was limited strictly to the legal basis. This is important. As I wrote earlier in Jan, the Trump administration can maintain the bulk of these tariffs on a different legal foundation and will indeed keep them in place — only under a different legal justification.This is supportive in the short term, but it does not remove the uncertainty surrounding near-term inflationary risks.In my view, I do not expect any rate cuts until June or September. You will see below, that even tho, market structure looks weak as long as it remains under 6950.77, and ES below 6977 And even tho, there is a huge thin-liquidity gap below the November lows down to May 9 levels, market doesn‘t expect the structure to be broken at all. Also note, that the 3-years moving average is at that May 9 gap level now, creating and even stronger structural downside support.It expects strong liqudity at December lows, and even more support and snapback at November lows in the worst case. While it looks sceptical about new ATHs in the near-term. See below. Watch ES 6855 for downside move confirmation. Below 6977, pressure on structure to the downside remains.
