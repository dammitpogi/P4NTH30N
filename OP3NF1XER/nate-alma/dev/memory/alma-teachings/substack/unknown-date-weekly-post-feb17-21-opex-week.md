Market analysisWeekly post (feb17-21), OpEx weekFeb 16, 2025∙ Paid4983ShareWe have monthly OpEx this week.Realized volatility came down during the past sessions, as expected despite the continous negative headlines. As I explained, market cleary signaled that they didn’t care about the news, they only wanted to catch volatility, but it reflexively led to lower vol, printed into realized volatility: Coding 3m RV at 12.97% and 20 day rolling RV at 14.29%Vol control strategies and CTAs are started to increase their exposure as their estimated net multipliers went above one. For simpliciy for now, here I give you two formulas:  Exposure multiplier=σtargetσcurrentWeightasset∝1σassetThe first formula expresses that if target volatility is equals to current vol, the multiplier is one. But if the current vol value goes below the target vol, the multiplier will be greater than one, meaning, they will increase their exposures (and conversely, if the current vol goes above the target vol, the multiplier will be lower than one, making them proportionaly decrease their exposure).While the second formula expresses, that the weight of a certain asset’s in the portfolio is proportional to the reciproc of the vol, or in other words, the position size in each asset is inversely proportional to its volatility. This is called risk parity. The lower the volatility goes, the higher its weight becomes in the portfolio, resulting increased buying activity. Here is an other formula is: Γ=e−rfτSστn(d1)This is gamma derived from Black-Scholes model, where: d1=ln⁡SK+(r+12σ2)(T−t)σT−t If we consider an ATM contract (S=K), the d₁ term is near to zero meaning n(d₁) is near its max. As both time t and volatility σ shrinks, the gamma will increase. Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
