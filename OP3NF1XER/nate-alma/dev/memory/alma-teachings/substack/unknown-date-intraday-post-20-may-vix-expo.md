Market analysisIntraday post (20/May), Vix expoMay 20, 2025∙ Paid12ShareBear market - biasHere is a summary of key points for my high probability bear market bias:Powell faces a no‑win between cutting too soon (fueling inflation) or too late (triggering a pull‑back). Higher import levies now hitting CPI, yet high rates won’t blunt cost‑push inflation.Warehouses are near capacity even as demand slows, squeezing margins and retail credit quality. Q1 saw vacancy tick up to 7% even as new supply slows, a sign inventories are piling up. Target and Walmart hiked inventories by 7 %/2.8% ahead of tariffs, then saw gross margins compress. 90‑day credit‑card delinquency jumped to 12.3%, while overall serious delinquencies climbed from 2% to 2.8% in Q1.Growth slowing with commodity prices down, but persistent inflation keeps real GDP growth subdued. A large June refinance of maturing debt and an unresolved debt‑ceiling fight threaten market liquidity and Treasury yields. Markets expect rate cuts only “after unemployment hits” and data turn—yet cuts too early risk reigniting inflation. 90‑day US/CN truce = supply shock, bcs pausing new tariffs doesn’t remove duties already in place; goods prices rose 0.2% m/m in April CPI. Reduced sailings and port congestion pushed container rates to multi‑year highs—even as global PMI shows only modest easing in supply‑chain pressures.Tariff‑shock effects on margins, credit, and growth can trigger sizable drawdowns (even 30%)—but only if data confirm a one‑two punch of slowdown plus sticky prices.Next week’s gonna be vol driven, likely vol down, spot up slow grind.*Note, if it turns out to be right that it is a bearmarket rally, what it implies is that in a bear market one should be very adaptive. While in a bull market one simply buys every dips, during a bear market you look for reversion trades and headlines and bonds in order to determine entries and exists. (Not shortin every tops, like my would think.) Bear market requires high ability to be adaptive. If you are unsecure about it, better wait for a clear setup.
