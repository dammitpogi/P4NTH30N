This is what I wrote:“For BoJ, most coverage points to a hold at 0.75% (after the December hike to 0.75%). As said in the yearly post, I expect a pause in rate hikes during the first half of the year. Which, if markets are leaning that way too, reduces the chance of a rates shock… but it heightens the sensitivity to any sign the BoJ is drifting away from that patience. So now, carry conditions can persist.However, if communication pushes investors to price earlier tightening, US momentum stock - selling can be expected (Japanese investors have accumulated dollars and bought US equities and bonds, often unhedged, in part because the yen depreciated for years and Japanese policy rates were extremely low).It depends on how much the gov worries of the near-term import inflation.”Japan’s government bond market saw a sharp sell-off: yields pushed above multi-decade highs, while the yen weakened to multi-month lows.  The driver is rising fiscal uncertainty—and, with it, a higher risk premium. This is reminiscent of the UK in 2022, when a fiscal-credibility shock sent gilt yields soaring and impaired financial stability, prompting the Bank of England to launch a temporary, targeted long‑gilt purchase programme to restore “orderly market conditions”.Fitch has argued that the deficits are manageable, but it also highlighted that Japan’s debt ratio remains the highest among advanced economies—on the order of >230% of GDP.In this context, the Ministry of Finance’s efforts to support the yen may prove insufficient. As an IMF publication notes:So if the market starts to price in fiscal dominance (i.e., monetary policy being forced to safeguard the government’s financing capacity), then 1) part of the bond-market premium can migrate into FX, and 2) the yen becomes the balance-sheet “collateral” through which the system reprices. The rise in yields therefore is no longer a “reward” (carry), but a “penalty” (risk premium).But then how can the yen be holding up against the USD?Because the US–EU diplomatic dispute has given de-dollarization fresh momentum, and the yen is weakening primarily against the euro instead:This is crucial from a carry-trade perspective, because Japan effectively has only two choices: 1) accept higher interest rates and risk a debt crisis, or 2) cap yields—in which case the yen depreciates. However, the “sell America” momentum may, in the short run, mask yen weakness versus the dollar, yet it embeds asymmetric tail risk, as the yen could start trading like a “fiscal stress / risk‑off” currency. The carry trade has therefore deteriorated in quality: for the same tail risk, there is less potential upside in USD/JPY if the USD is falling on its own.Looking at inflation pass‑through and potential policy responses, my view remains that yen weakness may still be with us through the first half of 2026. Later, however, the yen could strengthen back toward ~140 against the dollar—especially if the US–EU diplomatic dispute is resolved. The main reason is the rise in imported inflation driven by the weak yen, which the central bank will ultimately have to manage.   But the most important reason is the weakness of the dollar, ultimately leading to USD‑carry deleveraging.SPX & NDXThe geopolitical realignment—and with it, de-dollarization—continues.Since 1 January, the SPX is up 0.8% in USD terms, but it is down 0.11% in EUR terms and down 9.75% when measured in gold.The same pattern holds for the NDX: it is up 1.24% in USD terms, but only up 0.26% in EUR terms, and it is down 9.72% when measured in gold.Retail trading volumes in January 2026 are running ~40% above the average January level over 2020–2025, in both cash equities and options. This flow is on the supportive side and, in the short run, shows up as persistent negative speed exposure on the market‑maker side. (Most of the activity is concentrated in stocks linked to rare earths, the drone industry, nuclear energy, and crypto‑related themes.) This implies that traders are typically short OTM puts and long OTM calls—creating synthetic leverage via dealer hedging flows on the bid, while reflexively suppressing downside volatility. That, in turn, triggers local hedge unwinds and vol compression, and therefore additional vol‑control buyback flows and positive rebalancing flows. The effect is likely to grow—especially given that Nasdaq has recently approved Monday and Wednesday single‑stock option expirations (in the mould of 0DTE options), which should further lift retail volumes by improving flexibility. It is therefore unsurprising that the most heavily shorted stocks have outperformed in recent weeks. Another important aspect is that vol‑of‑vol is also being sold—both synthetically and directly—via deep OTM put selling, VIX call selling, institutional buyback programmes (Citadel, BlackRock), and outflows from money‑market funds. This applies both to the bond market (“Bessent put”) and to the equity market.This is reinforced by money‑market funds (MMFs), which—as I flagged over the course of last year—have begun to shrink their asset base: Since the start of the year, roughly a 1.35% outflow (in dollar terms) has occurred, which is the largest time‑adjusted outflow since April 2025. This suggests that parked cash has started to rotate back into riskier assets in early 2026. The liquid reserves accumulated in MMFs therefore represent potential buying firepower for equity and bond markets over the coming weeks.The net effect is that the kurtosis of the expected return distribution is being compressed: the left tail is still present, but its magnitude has been materially reduced.In other words, due to intervention by large market participants, the market can only experience managed, temporary drawdowns; they are not allowing it to collapse. In the short run, an illusion of stability is being maintained; over the longer run, however, risks are accumulating. More on that later. For now, the objective is to keep front‑end volatility and vol‑of‑vol in check, because both the market and the broader geopolitical backdrop are on the cusp of a regime shift. The market is being protected at all costs from a larger crash that would deteriorate economic statistics and sentiment.Year‑to‑date, RTY has outperformed NDX by roughly 7.3%—meaning that on every day of 2026 so far, small caps have outperformed mega‑cap technology: This behaviour is also evident in the broader SPX. Since 29 October, a modest rotation out of technology has been visible:There has also been significant rotation within the top 100 blue‑chip names since 29 October: However, the rotation has primarily been led by tech: At the same time, market breadth has genuinely been improving since 29 October:In other words, it is no longer just a handful of mega‑caps pulling the indices higher; an increasing number of sectors are contributing to today’s index level. I warned about this trend last year, and this broadening helps damp volatility—and the effect is only strengthening:This rotation is, on the one hand, a consolidation phase for tech, and on the other hand, an early signal of pressure coming from the European Union and China. With volatility being capped, the bull–bear spread is running at roughly three times its long‑run average. This reflects strong optimism, and abundant retail liquidity can provide near‑term support—especially during minor pullbacks. At the same time, as equity participation broadens, attention shifts toward sector rotation and fundamentals rather than purely index moves, which—as I noted—are being managed in order to keep the distribution under control against external shocks.Yields curvesFor most of 2025, the US yield curve was extremely flat and inverted; in early 2026 it appears to have reached a technical “support” level. Over recent weeks, asset managers have begun buying longer‑dated bonds and selling shorter‑dated paper—effectively putting on curve steepeners.At the same time, CTA strategies in rates remain positioned short: globally they are net sellers of bond futures, especially in the long end, while partially hedging via some buying in the front end. This suggests that systematic models are still leaning toward higher yields—consistent with a reflation narrative. The current US–EU standoff adds fuel to that dynamic, although the pressure is likely to be concentrated more in the technology sector. As I also wrote last December, I continue to view deep OTM put hedges in the US rates market as a desirable position.Since New Year’s the 2s–5s spread has widened by 12.27%:The 2s–10s yield spread has widened by 11.67%: The 2s–30s spread has widened by 12.25%:In all three cases, current levels are sitting between their 10‑year and 30‑year moving averages.Overall, a normalization process is starting to take shape—at least, that is the intended path. The market remains sensitive to political and inflation headlines, but overall liquidity has not deteriorated materially. The continuous presence of large institutional liquidity providers (e.g., Citadel Securities) provides a buffer effect: they have continued to supply bid/offer liquidity even through volatile episodes. Pricing in rates derivatives (e.g., interest rate swaps, FRAs) indicates that investors are pricing roughly one Fed rate cut in 2026, which is expected to stabilize the long end of the curve. There have also been strong inflows into global bond funds at the start of the year. Approximately ~$16.8 billion has gone into bond ETFs globally, with notable allocations into intermediate‑maturity government bond ETFs (roughly a 2–3 standard‑deviation inflow versus typical levels) and into municipal bond funds. A meaningful rotation is underway: money is flowing out of high‑yield credit (–1.5 standard deviations), while flowing into investment‑grade bonds (+1.2 standard deviations). This points to a more cautious, quality‑tilted investor posture. CFTC data likewise show leveraged funds net short US long bonds, while having established some net long exposure on the short end.Meanwhile, asset managers’ near‑record VIX short positioning suggests they are also looking for equity volatility to decline alongside bonds. Beyond indicating improved risk appetite, this implies an expectation of further upside in the near term—driven by fiscal and monetary stimulus—while inflation is not being treated as an immediate risk. That last point is critical.Gold and other metalsGold is up 85.85% since January 2025.The rally has been driven by three key forces: 1) An increasingly uncertain geopolitical backdrop and regime transition (e.g., concerns around Fed independence; US–Iran tensions; US–EU friction; US–China conflict; etc.); 2) Monetary-policy expectations, as anticipated US rate cuts reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, and 3) central-bank demand and ETF inflows: central banks purchased a record amount of gold in 2025 (e.g., China has been accumulating gold reserves for 14 consecutive months), while physically backed gold ETFs saw $89bn of net inflows over the year—also a historical high. In addition, the world’s largest gold ETF, SPDR Gold Trust, increased its holdings to 1,073 tonnes by end‑2025, the highest level in three years.Back in the summer-autumn of last year, I wrote that in my view gold would move above $5,000–$5,200 by this year‑end—which is not an encouraging signal for the macro environment.No fear of recessionHere I want to draw attention to an important process. Let’s look at gold relative to copper. In the chart below, you can see the copper‑to‑gold ratio versus US 10‑year Treasury yields (cyan) since January 2025:First, as context: among industrial metals, copper and related metals strengthened in early 2026, in parallel with analysts upgrading global growth expectations. Over the past few weeks, CTAs have also built long positions in both copper and gold (copper longs are around the 80th percentile). Meanwhile, $4.5bn flowed into commodity ETFs in a single week. Within that, roughly $3.7bn went into precious‑metals ETFs (primarily gold, e.g., GLD), $0.5bn into energy‑commodity ETFs (an unusually strong inflow—more than 3 standard deviations), and meaningful inflows also hit industrial‑metals ETFs (roughly a 4.9‑sigma anomaly).This matters because copper is a faithful proxy for global demand in the real economy—it is a foundational “civilization metal.” Across many analyses, copper prices (especially YoY changes) tend to co‑move with manufacturing activity (e.g., ISM Manufacturing PMI). Gold, by contrast, is a safe haven—a monetary hedge. It typically performs well when risk aversion rises and/or when the appeal of yield‑bearing alternatives declines. Importantly, this downtrend in the ratio did not begin recently; it began in 2021: Since October 2021, the ratio has fallen 55.02%—meaning gold has significantly outperformed copper—while 10‑year yields are up by 158.68%, i.e., the discount rate / financing hurdle has moved dramatically higher.Over this period, the rise in yields was driven primarily by an increase in the term premium, fueled by quantitative tightening, heavier Treasury issuance, and elevated uncertainty—while the growth/demand side was deteriorating. That is a classic stagflationary signal.However, I would add that throughout this period—until early 2025—the SPX/yields correlation showed a net negative tendency:In practice, that meant the market was primarily labeling inflation as the key risk, rather than slowing growth. During the 2022 bear market, sentiment tilted somewhat toward the view that “too much tightening” could push the economy into recession, but by 2023 the market once again consistently treated inflation as the dominant risk. From Q3 2024, the assessment began shifting again toward the view that slowing growth was becoming a larger risk than inflation. Even so, over the past five years the correlation has been net negative overall—suggesting the long‑run risk remains inflation, while the market still views a slowdown as manageable. That is a reasonable stance: with rates still relatively high, markets can expect additional monetary support if needed—but conditionally, that support should not undermine the soft‑landing narrative.This is internally consistent. If long yields are not being driven by a “growth scare,” but instead by term premium and supply factors, then the classic risk‑off hedge function is impaired. Moreover, a persistently negative SPX/yield correlation can itself contribute to a higher term premium.Gold, meanwhile, is being driven primarily by geopolitics, rather than functioning purely as an inflation hedge. Central‑bank gold demand in 2024 accounted for more than 20% of global demand, and after 2022 geopolitical factors gained prominence; the traditional real‑yield correlation has also broken down.Copper has not collapsed either: while the classic China fixed‑asset investment impulse has slowed, electrification (EVs, grids, renewables, data centers / AI) has introduced a new secular demand engine. Put simply, gold continues to outperform copper.That points to a powerful supply‑side and fragmentation shock.Tariffs, sanctions, logistical rerouting, and rising compliance costs slow and raise the cost of moving inputs. Supply chains are being re‑engineered (friend‑shoring, as I wrote about last year), and the required transport/inventory buffers are increasing. In effect, geopolitics is importing supply‑chain inflation into the global system: trade frictions and delays impair global throughput and can ultimately lead to developments (capex deferrals, tighter financing conditions, higher uncertainty) that damage global industrial demand.Over the same period, the copper‑to‑SPX ratio fell by roughly 24%. Taken together, these signals clearly suggest growing tension between financial asset prices and the physical cycle. In my view, equity cash flows have been “painted prettier” than underlying physical demand: organic growth is minimal, and financial results have been inflated through M&A accounting, buybacks, and accrual mechanics—artificially reducing the apparent degree of overvaluation, in a credit‑saturated system that Wall Street is happy to believe.In the near term, this can still be managed via so‑called “synthetic QE” (like MBS demand by the GSEs, tariff‑related stimulus checks, OBBBA fiscal stimulus, which could lift GDP growth by roughly 1%), tax rebates, caps on credit‑card interest rates, prescription‑drug price reforms, and Bessent’s long‑term yield management—and later via monetary easing under a new Fed chair. But this embeds long‑run inflation risk and a credit‑crisis risk into the system—on a much broader scale than twenty years ago.On the nature and drivers of the approaching crisis (including the AI/tech bubble, inflation dynamics, geopolitics, future regulation, and demographic aspects), I wrote in detail in the post below: The challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5Read full storyCTAs, Vol Control, Risk Parity Funds, InvestorsVolatility suppression embeds additional asymmetric risk. A volatilitás szupressziójára válaszul a CTA modellek 2026 elején összességében long pozícióban vannak a részvényekben globális szinten, ugyanakkor a piaci esésre való érzékenységük nőtt.In response to volatility suppression, CTA models are, on balance, long equities globally in early 2026, but their sensitivity to a downside move has increased. The major US equity indices are only about 1–2% away from the level at which CTAs, under their short-term trading rules, would begin to turn into net sellers. For now, they were still net buyers in energy last week (on the back of higher oil prices) and sellers in bonds. It is important to highlight the asymmetric risk embedded in CTA positioning. According to their model projections, if indices move sideways for a week, they would exert only modest selling pressure, and they would be incremental buyers (about 0.27x times smaller trade) if markets rise. By contrast, a one-week move lower could generate roughly 6.65x time bigger size of selling (than initially). Over longer horizons the asymmetry becomes even more pronounced. On a one-month horizon, a sideways market could imply around 2.7x bigger size of selling (than initially), while a 5% decline could trigger approximately 13.20x size more of potential selling, versus only about 0.07x smaller size of buying in a similarly sized rally. In other words, CTA models add only limited upside demand, but they de-risk much more aggressively on the downside.Volatility-control funds (which adjust portfolio weights as a function of realised volatility) are currently running extremely high equity exposure, around 95–98%. With realised volatility as low as it is, these models are at or near maximum equity weights. As a result, there is limited capacity for further incremental equity buying from this cohort, but if volatility spikes they will automatically become sellers as well, and in an asymmetric way.Risk-parity funds are similarly near 75–80% exposure, which is historically very overweight, while having slightly reduced commodity exposure. This indicates that multi-asset systematic strategies are positioned optimistically, taking advantage of the quieter tape, but in a volatility shock many could be forced to sell simultaneously.Investor sentiment has not improved. Funds are diversifying, scaling down exposure to US assets, and participating primarily via short-term, speculative momentum strategies. The Cboe COR3M Index is at a two-year low, reflecting elevated rotation. Index options have become relatively expensive versus single-stock options, as demand for hedges has increased across the 1–5 year horizon.Corporate buyback windowAs we approach the end of January 2026, an important technical development is the reopening of corporate share-repurchase windows. Due to earnings season, many companies have been in blackout since mid-December and were unable to repurchase shares. That buyback quiet period expires in late January/early February, so corporate repurchases should re-accelerate from February, providing an additional demand backstop and further compressing the kurtosis of the return distribution.Historically, February has been negative in 48.38% of observations. Strong January inflows often lose momentum, and February brings a correction before the market regains strength. This time, however, the US–EU conflict also increases risk into February OpEx.Earnings seasonCorporate earnings in 2025 consistently beat expectations, and in early 2026 fundamentals, together with expected fiscal and monetary support, should continue to provide a stable backstop in the near term. In my piece titled The challenges of 2026, I laid out explicitly where bubble-like features are showing up in earnings reports (through Nvidia and TSMC).Wall Street expects 2025 Q4 to be the 10th consecutive quarter of positive year-on-year EPS growth for the index. The FactSet consensus is looking for around +8.2% EPS growth in Q4 (y/y). It is important to emphasize that the market entered earnings season with cautious expectations. Into year-end 2025, profit forecasts were restrained, partly due to tariff-war uncertainty and tough base effects. As a result, the bar is low, and early reporters have already cleared it: so far roughly 79% of S&P companies have beaten EPS consensus (slightly above the 5- and 10-year averages), although the magnitude of the beats is smaller than usual (about 5.8% versus a typical 7–8%), which can be interpreted as an early sign of tightening financing conditions.Over recent weeks, analyst estimates have edged up in some sectors (for example, consumer discretionary) and been revised down in others (energy, healthcare). Overall there has been no major negative surprise; a profit recession looks avoidable in the near term, and the market appears prepared for this outcome and is not treating it as an immediate bubble-burst signal.That said, profit growth has accelerated in cyclical sectors (industrials, materials, utilities, financials), while mega-cap tech is already comping a high base and is finding incremental growth harder. In parallel, profit declines are likely in four sectors (for example, consumer staples and energy) versus last year, driven by high bases (oil-sector windfall profits in 2022–23) and margin pressure.It is also important that profit growth is improving in sectors more directly tied to the real economy, and this is not yet reflected in index weights: indices remain heavily concentrated in a few mega-cap tech names. Improving results in the periphery can therefore create larger relative moves. For example, if an industrial conglomerate reports unexpectedly strong numbers, the stock can deliver meaningful relative outperformance even if it has limited impact on the index because its weight is small. In other words, the largest moves may come from sectors with small index weight but improving profit trends, which would further reinforce rotation. Final thoughtsThe Trump administration has placed excessive emphasis on equity indices as a headline indicator of success, with a weaker dollar also contributing meaningfully to returns. If the market were to correct 10–15% during 2026, Trump’s political capital could evaporate quickly; today’s tailwind of rising 401(k) balances could easily become a political vulnerability. Maintaining the equity boom through the midterms therefore becomes a key objective at almost any price. The real risk is that these trends are artificially sustained for too long, making any eventual correction even more painful, and ultimately crystallising longer-term credit non-payment risk as investments fail to earn an adequate return.In the short run, the machine still works: fiscal stimulus and the prospect of monetary stimulus, together with buyback flows, all reduce tail risk and provide support to the market, while injecting additional liquidity into sectors to sustain growth for as long as possible. Problems begin when the toolkit is exhausted, and they run out of ammo.Into February OpEx, tail risk remains elevated because of the ongoing US–EU conflict. I think there is a meaningful probability of managed sell-offs designed to damp volatility, similar to last February. That would imply slower position reductions and high-volume intraday buy-the-dip speculation, aimed at reducing instability while systemic tail risk is still present. At the same time, liquidity is being channelled into the structural pivot areas I have laid out in my weekly posts, preventing the broader structure from failing. It is not only the algorithms; the narrative and retail speculators are also, for now, working in Trump’s favour.I still view the accumulation of risk, both geopolitically and from a market-valuation perspective, as becoming truly visible into the second quarter (the late-spring to summer window). That remains my window-of-risk target.It is important not to forget that, as the charts also show, geopolitical realignment and the search for the right narrative are what are currently driving markets and economies. This will end in a crisis, followed by a tokenized, AI-driven new economy.We are standing at the threshold of a historic regime change.
