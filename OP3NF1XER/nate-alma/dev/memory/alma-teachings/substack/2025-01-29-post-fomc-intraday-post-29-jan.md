As said, the main structure is shifted to being formed during the globex, as dedollarization continues, not a coincidence that Powell explicitly did not comment dollar. Also, in the weekly post I said, that Fed day looks like a positive day. For today, the Sunday post predicts a slight profit-taking day, but nothing trend changingFor ES futures 6990/6995 is the main pivot to the downside of 6950/55 and 6900, but for a leg down 6975/80 zone gives confirmation.For upside confirmation, watch the 7030 level.Above the main pivot, the upside vacuum is still on.For Gold 5280 is the main pivot, and 5595 is the upside pivot. I don’t trust this rally on the long term, slowly taking profits. Inflows are still ongoing, as rates are judged as too low.SubscribeLet’s look at the daily positioning… INTRADAY POST Coding today’s positioning: SPX speed profile is net negative. Traders are selling vol into both direction, but more vol is sold to the downside, protecting it. On the weekly basis the 6960-6920 zone is kinda thin, between two untested POCs, but gamma inflow increased by ~23% the while volume is down by roughly 17-18%. Mechanically this tightens the daily sigma range by 0.2-1.2 pts, compressing volatility by 0.12-0.2 pts at max, providing a downside braking effect and pushing the median of the distribution towards the downside pivot line (see below).  This means, traders are about to fill that zone with liquidity, in case of a retest that the market is betting on with 0DTE put spreads in small portion. Naturally if the market burns their theta above the centroid, and the spread-ish pattern cannot start to print (around the downside pivot), then they will unwind it, causing some tailwind to the upside. The centroid of the profile is at 6960.76, exactly at the top of that zone. This is a line in the sand, but any downside should be confirmed at 6945.14 (this zone is supportive and sticky locally. Downside pivot is at 6923.40target is 6913.22 There is a significant chance for a slow rejection back to the centroid if vol does not start to decrease here suddenly. If it does, 6900 is a magnet. (Market tolerates 6888 in case of a sudden “long call trade unwind”, if market accepts the level)Upside pivot is at 7014.06with target of 7028.56The target is sticky. Upside speed is slightly positive, but chance is high that the pivot would reject primarly back down to 6975/60, secondary, to 7000 and pin there if 6985/90 is held.
