Market analysisRight-tail, right-tail and right-tail... - Intraday post (12/Sept)Sep 12, 2025∙ Paid10ShareOn the weekly basis, the right-tail was realized by SPX being agressively pushed upwards on every stagflationary news: Due to the Bessent-put, the momentum was expected, but I didn’t expected it to be let to run this far this fast, but the futures roll-over started earlier, helping the upward momentum.You can see, that while vol of vol remains suppressed in a net basis, it realized a bit upward, after SPX broke the zone that was market by vomma supply on the weekly tenor: Volatility remains sticky around 9.43%; with a slight spot up/vol up after the momentum broke out of the marked ranges.This keeps risk high, and holds back vol control and CTA funds to increase their long exposure on equities. Funny enough, that SPX/yields correlation started to grind upwards again, after these events, creating a short-term “good news = good news” regime for algos, ahead of the coming rate cuts. So, inflationary pressures will be taken as a positive growth signal.The moderation of the realized meassures of this spot-upstick comes from the monthly exposure working in the background: We can expect some ranging into the FOMC at these elevated rates. This sudden, fast spike in the spot made a 92.13% reversion signal appear in my model, a very rare signal, with vol adjusted mean of 6363.25This can be moderated through time correction, but the model’s meassured risk constantly remains above 80%; this is why I don’t take longer-term positions. Until this risk isn’t washed out of the market. Again, I expect the window of risk starting after the OpEx (simply because the narrative will be gone), but we will see the next weekly positioning on Sunday how the Sept OpEx positioning evolves. However, the window of risk will be over by some statement from the admin, like tech based global trade announcement, or partial trade deals with asia, etc. I patiently wait. I see no reason to risk my hard earned profits… SubscribeLet’s look at today’s positioning… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
