Market analysisRecession, Stagflation, Risk + Intraday post (1/May)May 01, 2025∙ Paid201ShareIn my yesterday post you can read my insights on the coming datas and Fed. Very important. Bessent said de-escalation “is up to China,” because Chinese exports to the U.S. dwarf U.S. exports to China. He doubled down on a strong-dollar policy and warned Europe may need to cut rates to counter the euro’s strength. Euro-zone consumers’ three-year inflation expectations rose to 2.5%, up from 2.4%, indicating that the public is bracing for lasting price pressures even before tariffs bite fully. McDonald’s reported a 1% year-on-year drop in global comparable sales for Q1 2025, versus analyst forecasts of a 0.95% rise. And it keeps dropping.Weaker consumer spending and ongoing tariff escalation raise the risk of stagflation. Recent steep drops in copper futures (down 8.4% in April 2025) amid Chinese PMI weakness and trade‐war jitters underscore growing recessionary risks that are not yet fully reflected in broader markets. If you watch the rhetoric from the government and the Fed, it’s all about recession. Why? As I wrote over the weekend, the biggest and most immediate risk is a deflationary spiral. So they’re focused on stopping that first. The market knows it—speculators and mechanical flows can fuel a rally on that. Listen…Come June, it’s very likely the Fed will be forced to cut rates. I emphasize “forced”—not because all danger is past and growth can resume, but because they’ll have to act to avoid a deflationary spiral. Yet QE wouldn’t make sense given the stagflation backdrop. The market is currently underpricing that risk. So don’t expect genuine QE—only as real as 2022’s QT was.This is a bear-market rally. And as I can’t stress enough, come mid-summer—when tariff-driven inflation kicks in—the market is going to tank hard. There’s no investor confidence underpinning this rally; it’s purely a liquidity hunt.You’ve got to be extremely nimble and adaptable in this environment, because it’s so heavily driven by policymakers’ narratives. The market is mostly front-running them.But to time the decline is simply impossible now. In its April–June 2025 quarter, the Treasury expects to borrow $514 billion of net marketable debt, almost $150 billion more than prior estimates—assuming an end-June TGA of $850 billion. That $514 billion of new issuance flows directly into the TGA, removing an equivalent amount of reserves from banks and money markets. The Q2 marketable borrowing and the post–debt-ceiling replenishment of the TGA together will withdraw hundreds of billions from reserves just as the Fed is debating rate cuts. This reserve drain tightens funding conditions, amplifying the recessionary and stagflationary pressures you’ve already identified—and puts the Fed under even more pressure to ease despite sticky inflation.Two-year Treasury yields have already dropped below the Fed’s funds rate (4.25–4.50%), signaling markets expect rate cuts imminently. On the day jobless claims jumped, the 10-year yield slipped to 4.15%, and S&P 500 futures rallied—classic sign that weaker labor data leads to lower yields and risk-asset inflows. Powell has said rate cuts depend on clear signs of rising unemployment and slowing GDP—“only if unemployment hits and GDP” targets are met. With the unemployment rate still near 4.2% and claims elevated but not crisis-level, immediate yield drops are manageable. However, further jobless jumps could force two-year yields down by 100+ basis points in a matter of weeks—amplifying funding-market stress and potentially triggering margin calls in leveraged sectors. A large, rapid yield decline can disrupt money-market funds, bank balance sheets, and short-term funding, compounding the recessionary drag of rising unemployment.INTRADAY POST Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
