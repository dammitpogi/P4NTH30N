Market analysisChallenges for 2026 | Weekly post (05 - 09/Jan)Jan 04, 2026∙ Paid2222ShareYearly outlook, challenges for teh western economy: The challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5Read full storyReversion model flags 6,889.84 as the level that must hold for the rally to extend. There is no excessive short-term momentum on the horizon.On a multi-year basis, however, the model shows a 92.81% probability of a mean reversion below 6,000. In backtests, I typically need 95%+ to call a high-conviction topping signal, but this reading already helps explain why investors are in “sell-into-strength” mode.(These signals appeared in 2019, 2020, 2022, and again in 2025 ahead of the April crash)What I expect next is a time correction: a wider, range-bound regime and liquidity hunting into the FOMC, to cool off the mechanical risk metrics. SubscribeGeopoliticsI previously highlighted the risk around the Venezuelan situation. By moving to apprehend Maduro—a Russia- and China-aligned dictator—the U.S. is pushing back against de-dollarization, since the bulk of global oil trade is conducted in dollars, and it can also secure more durable control over global oil supply. That reduces dependence on Middle Eastern OPEC producers and allows oil prices—and therefore inflation—to be influenced, especially to offset the impact of tariffs.This also contributes to managing the debt burden: the U.S. can borrow cheaply in its own currency because international reserve demand supports the dollar and helps keep U.S. Treasury yields lower—what Giscard d’Estaing called the “exorbitant privilege.” In the short term, the market can plausibly expect fiscal support and then monetary support; in the long term, however, this is problematic.China will not ignore this geopolitical realignment, so the geopolitical risk premium remains elevated.Market riskRisk appetite among speculators is above 85%, which is extremely high. Leverage is at record highs, while rotation across the market remains slow.Roughly 40% of market momentum is coming from AI-linked equities. These names are materially overvalued because there is oversupply in AI infrastructure, which continuously depreciates, and much of the capex will not earn an adequate return. This is being masked through various accounting tricks. Companies are funding excessive spending with credit, which is a time bomb for the economy because these assets erode over time. That will ultimately force both the Fed and the government back toward stimulus—adding further inflationary pressure. But more on that in another post…The short VIX trade is crowded, which builds meaningful vomma risk over the longer run.Meanwhile, the government publishes only narrative-consistent, cosmetically adjusted economic data, even though in reality people are paying more for less value—stagflation remains a feature. SubscribeMicrostructureRetail investors will likely remain important drivers of liquidity and price discovery. This is supported by the fact that in 2025 household net worth and equity exposure grew to record highs, alongside leverage, which reinforces BTD and FOMO behavior over the medium term.Large institutional investors are steadily increasing allocations to low-risk assets. This is a hidden short-speed position: we should not expect strong long-squeeze dynamics in a selloff, but it leaves them with more capacity to step in during drawdowns.Rotation is not only occurring at the index level, but also across sectors. Some capital is moving into value and cyclical names. By late 2025, previously lagging segments—such as energy and industrials—remain underrepresented in market cap despite improving fundamentals. If those fundamentals continue to improve, these sectors can gain a larger share of the overall market, and there are already signs that investors are beginning to reallocate in that direction.This temporarily reduces concentration risk, while we can still expect expansion in tech to be framed positively.Overall, supportive forces are still present, but the market needs more room to grow and must keep the bullish narrative alive. I expect more meaningful weakness into spring; until then, the base case is rotation and range-bound trade. This market favors speculators more than investors, and long-term risk remains very high.
