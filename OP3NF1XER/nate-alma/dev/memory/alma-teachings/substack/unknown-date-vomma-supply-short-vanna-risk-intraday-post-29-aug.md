Market analysisVomma supply, Short vanna, Risk - Intraday post (29/Aug)Aug 29, 2025∙ Paid11ShareWeekly post: Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)Alma·August 24, 2025Last week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.Read full story(Yesterday post was free for everybody)Here I wrote about PCE: NVDA ER, GDP, PCE, Valuation - Intraday post (27/Aug)Alma·August 27, 2025Read full storyVomma supply is on (grey line), and very heavy, as we keep seeing it day by day, week by week: especially on the right-tail, because spot/vol beta is about 21.01% with an avg of 16.24%: The reason is illiquidity and short squeeze. I also note here that 3m realized volatility is at 9.38% while 1m-RV is at 10.11%, while realized vvol is sold from 81.3% to 26.59% in only one week! This is an agressive “higher for longer” vol environment making quant funds to scale out of long exposures, decreasing insitutional buying flow in terms of investment purpose (because they buyback hedges, levered up through MM buybacks as well, as put spreads etc. are closed).This means that the current SPX levels are not stable at all, and will be held until Sept cut, simultanously compressing risk premium. In the weekly post, I already elaborated on the reason of this. This is a cautious “stairstep-up”/”elevator up” kind of scenario, while funds cautiously keep upside squeezes in check as well. Through vomma supply, concentrated on the right-tail of the distribution, they create a “braking” effect, in order to extend this melt-up momentum. With this, long vol/long delta strategies can’t really capitalize on this move, while locking the cheapness of the downside hedges, vvariances for the future correction. The secondary effect is cooling down quant algos that take the velocity of the momentum into account, so they meassure lower risk.  If volatility would be sold, market would not find enough liquidity at these levels. Simply because, market is about supply and demand balance. If customers sell vanna, they bet on negative spot/vol correlation (simply because the delta vs. volatility relationship is inverse in this position). Now, firstly it opens up the left-tail; secondly, when spot goes through the centroid of the vanna and speed profile to the upside, the imbalance shifts to the sell-side. In order to realize the distribution bet, market needs customers who buy all these sold assets at those prices. And this selling flow is increasing as spot is climbing upward. It is clear now that there is no such high buying liquidity here that could swallow all that potential selling, because there is no faith, no fundamental support for that. Funds are scaling out to cash and safe-havens, and retails are highly volatile traders. However, through buying vanna from dealers, levering-up the upside squeeze, once can amplify the move, but also braking it simultanously by flattening the convexity through vomma selling. And as said, the ultimate benefit is cheap hedges against vol squeezes in the future… Don’t forget: it’s not about inflation, it’s about the growing debt burden!This is what Trump is aiming to manage. And this is why he slowly gains full control on Fed and others…Also, we will see EOM rebalancing from investors who reduce their stock exposures due to the high risk, and buying bonds and safe havens. The reason is the high stock prices, that increases the weight of stocks in the portfolio against low risk assets. It caps upside.
