Market analysisWhat is vomma supply? Why is it important? - Intraday post (04/Sept)Sep 04, 2025∙ Paid161ShareAs everybody already knows that the coming Fed cut will be a hawkish cut due to the checkmate situation, volatility keeps being managed for this week and day to day.Vomma selling is basically like selling VIX calls or selling tail SPX OTM puts/calls for the dealers and bidding up gamma at the tails. It doesn’t prevent wider intraday swings, it lets the spot moves kinda freely in a relatively wide range, but it prevents vol spikes, it dampens any upsticks, by compressing the kurtosis of the distribution. This is a less agressive strategy than constantly selling volatility, dumping it down to hell, like it was done in 2022. Those setups are like an extended rubber band, they are very sensitive to any vol spikes, leading into a vol squeeze.For a vomma squeeze, market needs extreme tail event. But we need to know where the “event horizonz" of the tail” lies. Thats something I built formulas for as well. So vomma supply doesn’t mean that volatility is suppressed. It only means that, the more vol goes up, the more vol exposure the dealers get, so they will sell volatility. (think like this: long vomma = vol up/vega up = selling vega by dealers to hedge)Or think about it like supplying the dealers with VIX upside gamma. And because VIX smirk is mostly concave (especially for longer maturities), but have an upward skew for sure (it is because of the modelled mean reverting tendency of volatility), when VIX spikes, dealers will have a lot to delta hedge (and maybe VIX-vega hedge as well, but it’s conditional), capping the vol spike, and creating a VIX-to-SPX lead-lag. This is because VIX is the 30-day variance object derived from SPX options, so spot moves change SPX option vol premiums and so thus the implied variance curve (think vanna/cross-gamma), which moves VIX futures. To reduce this additional exposure, dealers add an ES hedge sized by the VX–ES beta. The result is buying ES futures at the tail strikes, dampening or even braking the spot move. It can work both ways, as I keep telling. Because spot/vol correlation can be both positive and negative.The third thing is to simply sell tail SPX puts, that are basically synthetic VIX calls. You can see a lot of this on these intraday setups, OptionsDepth Heatmaps… especially to the upside, because in the recent times, intraday setups and even weekly/monthly setups where kept being right-tail heavy. And so, by creating positive gammas to both upside and downside, it simply builds heavy gamma walls to the spot that swallow vol spike-driven spot moves, by leveraging dealer hedging flow. The net result is a compressed kurtosis for SPX distribution. Thinner tails, reduced tail-risks to both direction, and controlled volatility swings. SubscribePlaying with inflation swaps or any assets that fits the narrative is only a metaphorical “vomma supply” as it keeps sentiment in check. For example, now, the short-term SPY/yields correlation is dumped again. This makes algos and retails to buy every dip on weak datas as those datas will trigger Fed cut (“bad news are god news”). Okay, so now let’s jump into today’s positioning… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
