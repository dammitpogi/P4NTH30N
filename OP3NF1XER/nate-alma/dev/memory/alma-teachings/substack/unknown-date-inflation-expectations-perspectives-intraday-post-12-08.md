Market analysisInflation expectations, Perspectives - Intraday post (12/08)Aug 12, 2025∙ Paid101ShareHere is the weekly post: CPI and OpEx week - Weekly post (11/Aug - 15/Aug)Alma·August 10, 2025Read full storyMarket keeps trending at the centroid of the weekly OpEx positioning Everything depends on the sentiment, because market is up on earnings and Sept cut hopes. My job is to tell you what distribution the market prices and what happens in certain scenarios. Market cannot always be frontrunned, and predicted.Most of the times we can only determine the risk and hedge it, while simultaniously play the present moves just like we did last week with the bullish move. It is not a guessing-race… that’s a bad “furu” behavior…The whole CPI and PPI release will reveal how much influence the government has on Fed.The question is if disinflation is happening or tariff generated pressures remain and create a sticky or even climbing inflation. Overall the market expects inflation on the front-end (1-3 year window) as a result of tariffs that will moderate later.The curve of inflation swaps are declined since QT in 2022, but seems like bottomed when the Fed first cut rates. In the April/May period, despite the recessionary and even temporal deflationary concerns, the market started to expect even higher inflation due to tariffs, and stagflationary pressures, meaning that the Fed won’t be able to handle both simultanously. I tell you what to look for…First, the market expects a neutral print, rather a hot or cold print. It expects sticky uncertainity, and most likely will wait until PPI and Jackson Hole, expanding my risk window. And OpEx will still cap the downside until. This is the market’s expectation. However, if the inflationary pressures are not significant, or even there is a small hint of cooling pressure, or turning towards disinflation (increased rate of cooling), if Sept cut happens, the market will take profit. Simply, because the Fed doesn’t cut because of no-inflation risk, but because of slowing growth, political manipulation and growing debt burden. A hawkish, emergency cut, rather a green light. It would not be bearish, but corrective…This is why the market is telling us that it is not happy about bad news at all: I wait until data releases, then reassume. For today, I show you what the market expects, and what is the plan until…Let see what distribution and reactions the positioning implies…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
