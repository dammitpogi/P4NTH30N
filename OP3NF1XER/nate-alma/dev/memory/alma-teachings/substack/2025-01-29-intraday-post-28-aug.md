The right-tailedness is like 6.36% bigger than the left-tail below the centroid, so not a big difference, but it is there, and upside vomma is pretty much sold again (relative to downside vomma).The reason is the the 6493 gamma that is pretty magnetic during the session. These all takes me to the calculation that market bets on an ranging between the centroid and 6493 gamma, and a potential pin there if upside pivot is broken.Upside pivot is at 6486.85; from here the gamma of 6493 is magnetic. During the power hour it serves as a line in the sand in order to decide to pin to the upside or to the centroid. (margin of error of 6475) Only if call skew gets heavily bid by more than 20.83% (on a fix strike basis in the 30/22 delta calls), thats when this 6493 line can be broken, and then I code 6522.98 as max target. During the power hour it can pin, if call skew remains bid and spot hold 6511Downside pivot is 6462.61;this is a heavy line to break. Strong put skew bid is needed with an at least 82.30% increase in the 30/20 delta puts to break below this line. Then, 6412.44 is the downside target with margin of error of 6405. But again, the tailedness is very small on both sides, only right-tail is a bit bigger. The main bet is a choppy, premium burning upward grind to 6495. Futures seems to work better today, than options. If one smells presigns of reversions, 1-2DTE ITMs are prefered.OptionsDepth Heatmap (Description is here)(to sign up, use ‘ODALMA’ for 10% discount)Educational postsMy basic trading principlesAlma·July 2, 2025In this post I will examine the psychological aspects of trading.
