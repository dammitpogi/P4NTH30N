Market analysisOpEx, VIXpery and PCE week | Weekly post (17-20/Feb) Feb 16, 2026311SharePython quant course is already available on my Substack-site, by an ex-Wall Street quant.Few times ago, a high significance red-dot appeared on my famous reversion model on the longer time-frame.In this post below, I investigated and explained the reasons: Market analysisThe challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significant—yet still underpriced—risk in the market.Read full storyAnd a free post where I covered institutional flows, ERs, general sentiment and macro context: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026Alma·Jan 23Read full storyStructurally the market is weak. Distribution keeps going on. Almost everything I wrote about is coming true, see the post linked above, where I collected my insights about the market, the bubble and the structure. Structural cracks have started to appear for everyone, but I don’t think it is the end of the cycle now. Market is about to build a stable support even if it’s only mechanical.For now, NASDAQ is very clear with its ranging pattern since last October FOMC, while SPX is shaky. SubscribeOn this short week, we have FOMC minutes on Wednesday, then PCE and GDP on Friday, along with VIX expo and monthly OpEx. For data release, momentum is shifting towards “good news is good news”.Customers are net selling straddles into Tuesday and Wednesday downward, then a wider and more upside skewed-one into Thursday, then a risk reversal into Friday. I will analyse these more in details, below… Let’s check how the OpEx positioning evolved during the last week: Net gamma exposure has grown by 44.56% total, especially in the range below recent strike ATM. The clusters, where the strongest gamma effect is concentrating are at 6944.09 and 6599.89, marking this band for SPX:Momentum-speaking, as long as SPX remains under 6965.66, there will be no upward trend confirmed: My other momentum model says, market is at monthly equilibrium, ready to start to accumulate negative disbalance, however a weekly avg spot above 6912.76 could disprove it. Below, I will scrutinize, what the market is betting on for these four days… SubscribeFor now, keep your eyes on 6768.47 for ES and 24,327.71 for NQ for any downside momentum to gain confirmation. 6905 for ES and 25,066.36 for NQ are kinda local pivots, but momentum must be confirmet higher. These levels can be used for rangebound games. If both SPX and ES loses 6600, the spot will go back to July levels as market goes against what customers expect. Let’s look at, how the market positions itself for the week… WEEKLY POSITIONING Here you can see the weekly positioning:Speed profileThe net speed profile is positive into Friday, meaning customers are selling upside vol, and buying downside vol. Kinda symmetrical. Centroid is at 6744.05 - 6716.20 range.Downside pivot is at 6611.51Target is 6570.38Upside pivot is at 6907.77Target is 6962.43This pretty much aligns with the technical structure of SPX. Dealer exposure greeksNet gamma is locally negative in the range, meaning customers are net buyers of realized volatility, whileNet color is also negative into Thursday (gamma decreases the most into Wednesday), and flips to positive into Friday. This means that into Thursday market bets on realized volatility expansion into Thursday. Towards the downside (~6678.82 and below), the local net gamma is positive into Wednesday that is supportive, but local color is still negative, pushing the local net gamma to positive, then color flips and pushes local gamm back to neutral into Friday. To the upside (~6943.05 and above) the local gamma monoton decreases but in a lower pace and remains positive, and net speed also remains positive.Net zomma is positive. And on Tue-Wed, there is more zomma on vol down moves, then it becomes very low balanced into Friday. This means, customers expect ATM IV sellers to be trapped along the week. On the downside, the zomma effect increases, skewed towards vol up moves, and flips to negative into Friday. This tells me, that as spot falls, they expect the sudden vol spikes to be shorted, and spot to be stabilized, and expect ‘vol down’ spot stabilization only on Friday… if spot is there.  Net vega exposure is locally negative too, in the marked range, withNet veta being heavily positive within the range and negative out of it. Downside vega is positive and decreases to negative into Thursday, then decays to zero into Friday. This indicates mechanical vol selling within the range and in case of spot starts to fall. From Thu to Fri, downside is supportive with ‘vol down’ move, aligning with the zomma exposure. Net vomma is negative within the range skewed towards ‘vol down’ moves, and impact is increasing into Friday, but relatively low. It is like market expects IV selling. Downside vomma is however positive, so downside vol spikes gonna be sold, and the impact is way higher, ultima is skewed towards ‘vol up’ moves. (Upside vomma is also net positive, set to break any squeezes, and very highly skewed towards vol up moves.)Net vanna is positive within the range, but negative to the downside. So within the range, market expects more negative spot/vol correlation while to the downside, they expect it to increase. Upside vanna is positive but almost zero impact. Pain is upSo to me, this seems like customers plan to short IV downward into Wednesday, then short vol expecting stabilization or rebound into Thursday and hedge downside heavily into Friday. Like filling downside with liquidity to build a strong support into the coming months, to go towards 7100 during the year after a correction.Upside is the pain trade because the upcoming PCE number is the catalyst, and the market’s auction structure (a failed move down, bear-trap + nearby thin/single-print structure) makes it easier for price to rotate upward, especially with lots of people positioned bearish.The key level is 6840 in terms of buyback flow.  Skews show growing hedging into Thursday, fear is in:Vomma projected zones:6673.90 - 6725.99 as the downside expectation for the week, and6902.62 - 6934.03 is the upside expectation.As you can see, market expects a false breakout to the downside. Sentiment projectionPutting all together, the projected sentiment is like the week’s core atmosphere is credibility, fog, reframing, and the cost of illusion, while risk appetite support/“valuations want to float”/softness, relief bids, or “it still wants up” mentality increases day by day.Tuesday: mixed‑to‑constructive, but reactive, volatility is high and rising, wider ranging.Wednesday: “volatility-apex” day, very sensitive day. Optimism about inflation is possible, causing a melt-up later.Thursday: shock energy releasing, defensive positioning, market is expected to test support, slowly unfolding consolidation/vol selling, with flat-to-negative drift,Friday: peak of the fog‑meets‑reality sentiment, most likely rebound and snapbackDip-buyers are ready to step in lower on the range. In the middle, it is fragile. Any bid will be mechanical.
