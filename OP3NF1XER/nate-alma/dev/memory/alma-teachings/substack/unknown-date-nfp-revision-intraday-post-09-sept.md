In August, the unemployment rate went up by 4.3%, NFP increased only by 22k. What this data suggest is that job growth reached a pivot in May since COVID crisis. This is a big red-flag, and will have longer-term consequences. The next 3-5 year will lead to a global crisis for the western world before stockmarket will be integrated to Web3 (reason is explained in the “Playing the AI-Bubble” post). SubscribeSo today the 2025 preliminary benchmark revision is publiced, and market expects a large downward preliminary revision. This would smean, that growth was weaker than first reported over Apr-2024 to Mar-2025. However, as you can see, the final revision (Feb 2026) is usually revised a bit higher. Anyways, it’d say labor market had already cooled more than the monthly CES prints showed. But market doesn’t expect negative growth, just slowed positive growth. And according to the market it would be a good news because it provides further opportunity for a hawkish “insurance cut”. They would not be happy about it, but it provides further occassion to buy the dip until the cut happens.
