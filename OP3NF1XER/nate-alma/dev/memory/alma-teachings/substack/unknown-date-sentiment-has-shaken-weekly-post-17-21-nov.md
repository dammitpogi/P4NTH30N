Market analysisSentiment has shaken - Weekly post (17-21/Nov)Nov 16, 2025∙ Paid229ShareUpdated Window of Risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Alma·October 29, 2025Read full storyMarket has finally seriously shaken, but structure has not broken. It was tested but market held the marked lower bound at 6650.13 The reason I say ‘seriously shaken’ is that the sell wasn’t the cause of mechanical flows but strictly sentiment-driven. As I keep warning you over the past 2 weeks, market has a lot of mispriced risk, plus the admin’s position is also challenged: 1) as I showed you, the AI/tech sector has significant misvaluations and faces supply-chain risk; 2) Trump’s position is weakening he is losing leverage against the ‘deep state’ and against his foreign opponents.Based on some intels, I estimate serious troubles for him into next Q1, late February-March period, and market will feel it, because all what happened since April was built on the faked reality that the admin projected, and that the public trusts less and less now… this is the key! This is a big sentiment pivot.I don’t expect bear market, but that period is my next window of risk target, after this current one. SubscribeThe risk/liquidity proxy asset, Bitcoin also broke my marked 107k pivot, and most likely heading towards my marked downside targets. In my July post, I predicted topping into August and volatility after October. Voilá, it is happening… targets are still the same. Structurally, it should rebound now back towards 112-115k and lose structure there to confirm downward move for the coming months. This coming week is risk heavy: first, we have OpEx, but before that we have VIX expiration, NVDA earnings and NFP release. Me personally, I’m not into shorting this now, at least not until NVDA ER, the guide matters as it can amplify the depreciation/ROI concerns.My personal short-term strat is rather building long positions into Dec rally (potentially triggered by further Fed cut), with primarly not expecting new ATHs.My bias for a Santa rally is intact yet. The more lower the market is let to go, the better and more stable the rally will be. But from now, every rally will be considered very fragile. Market is starting to wake up from an euphoria, and will realize that it has outrun itself. It is a house of cards. The trust is shaken, looking for the reality. Trump wants to avoid blackswan (I think he will), but his leverage is running out of ammo. Plus datas are back, and as I said, data is very risky now…SubscribeLet’s see, what can we expect from OpEx, and what levels, pivots and structure the positioning projects ahead… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
