Market analysisAhead of FOMC, Intraday post (05/May)Elaborating on the bulltrapMay 05, 2025∙ Paid1511ShareI added very important levels and notes to the weekly post. Refresh and re-read it! Also on Sunday, I posted a list of books and researches that help you to think in distribution instead of constant duality. The U.S. Commerce Department’s Section 232 probe into semiconductors opened a public comment period that ends this Wednesday, May 7—after which the administration can impose tariffs without further notice. Only ten comments have been filed on semiconductor tariffs, versus ~300 for prior copper or lumber probes—suggesting limited industry or public resistance, which the Trump team could read as tacit approval. 25% - 100% duties may be imposed as soon as this week, keyed to the “wafer-out” location where chips are made. The probe covers everything from substrates and bare wafers to advanced chips and manufacturing equipment, underlining the broad reach of any final tariffs.With the comment window closing mid-week, tariffs could be announced immediately before or after the Fed’s May 6–7 meeting—adding a fresh growth-shock uncertainty. The lack of industry filings means minimal opposition, making it more likely that the Trump administration will see a clear runway to enact steep tariffs. Heavy chip duties would raise input costs, squeeze margins, and slow semiconductor-driven capex—potentially delaying Fed rate cuts or even forcing additional tightening, exactly as I warned you. If tariffs land just before the Fed, it amplifies reasons to “sell into strength” ahead of the rate-decision, as it adds another headwind to growth. Markets have already repriced Fed cuts out to July; an imminent chip-tariff shock could push that horizon even further—and steepen the yield curve’s back end. Risk/reward is still on the short delta side (while I hedge upside, and vol decay).
