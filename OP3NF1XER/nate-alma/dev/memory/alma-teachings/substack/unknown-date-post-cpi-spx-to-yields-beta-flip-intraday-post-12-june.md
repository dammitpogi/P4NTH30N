Market analysisPost-CPI, SPX to yields beta flip + Intraday post (12/June)Jun 12, 2025∙ Paid111ShareYesterday, I signaled you that my reversion model gave the 80%+ signal for a reversion what I’ve been waiting for to go short. Market fell 70 pts+ since. However, momentum and sentiment-wise, as long as SPX can close above 5955, ES=F above 5968.10, NDX above 21,549.18 and NQ=F above 21,603.46, pullback is not confirmed. The SPX/yields beta flipped to positive just right ahead of CPI release, as I expected on Sunday. Market reacted to softer prints as it was signaled by the beta: reacting with pullback for a softer-than-expected print. This marks a shift to a regime where yield moves are dominated by term-premium normalization—driven by fiscal deficits and heavy issuance—and anchored inflation expectations. Stable core inflation prints and clear forward guidance have convinced markets the Fed will look through term-premium–driven yield spikes unless core CPI deviates markedly, decoupling long yields from immediate policy-rate risk. Post‐CPI data confirm real yields climbing, break-even inflation subdued, and term premium elevated—hallmarks of a growth-driven yield regime. The equity-risk premium has fallen toward zero, and valuation indicators (e.g., Shiller CAPE in the 94th percentile) warn stocks are richly priced, so positive yield shocks now often trigger a “catch-up” bid in equities and vice versa. Core CPI at 2.8% Y/Y and moderate headline prints have reassured markets that the Fed will “look through” term-premium-driven yield spikes, decoupling long yields from near-term rate-hike risks.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 139,000 in May—above expectations—with wage growth accelerating, underscoring broad-based labor resilience rather than a cooling trend. Despite rate-cut hopes, traders now see only a 23% chance of a July cut and 76% by September—down from peaks—reflecting respect for labor-market resilience over headline CPI alone.The thing is that the elevation (higher lows) is an underlying trend in the beta. Markets now fear a growth slowdown or even deflationary shock more than runaway inflation, so soft economic prints (lower yields) now drag equities down. Contrary to the old “Fed put” mentality, weak data can no longer be reflexively positive because it undermines the growth cue in yields. The Fed’s pivot point has moved: it cares less about term-premium ticks and more about core inflation and labor dynamics—reinforcing that only a genuine downturn will prompt cuts.And it was the real underlying concern during May, and it flipped on Tuesday-Wednesday. Let’s see, if this trend continues. SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
