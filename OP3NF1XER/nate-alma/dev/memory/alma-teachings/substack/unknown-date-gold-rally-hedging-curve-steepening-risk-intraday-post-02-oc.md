The Fed’s easing bias and upside risk to breakevens are the bullish pillars.Gold is effectively short beta to real yields, so the biggest left-tail is a real-yield backup / curve steepener—that’s what we should hedge.Gold doesn’t produce cash flow and is prone to regime swings. It’s a hedge/insurance, not a compounding engine. So, treat gold as exposure to inflation/real-rate factors rather than an “asset class.” Size it by risk budget and factor diversification, not notional. Manage the overlap with duration/ breakeven risk in the rest of the portfolio, so you don’t double up on the same macro bet. SubscribeMeasure your portfolio’s gold to real-rate beta: regress Δgold vs Δ10y TIPS yield and vs Δbreakeven; update rolling. Adjust rates-up hedges to the beta. TY/US put spreads (short 10y/long-bond futures via puts) sized by DV01 to your estimated gold–rates beta (mind vol risk!). Or bear-steepener options (2s10s/5s30s payer spreads) to cover a potential curve-steepening risk… GLD/XAU puts or collars (e.g., 3–6M 25Δ put financed with a 10–15Δ call sale) to protect against ETF-inflow stall/reversal. Because downside is on the table if ETF inflows stop.Or if you’re not set up to manage rate hedges, consider simpler collars or a multi-asset inflation sleeve (gold + TIPS + commodities) to diversify the bet.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
