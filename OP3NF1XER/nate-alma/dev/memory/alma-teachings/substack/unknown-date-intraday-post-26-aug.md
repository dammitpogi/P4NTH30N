Market analysisIntraday post (26/Aug)Aug 26, 2025∙ Paid133ShareSUBSTACK UPDATE: Next month I will change the currency of payment from USD to EUR. Depending on the market, it can mean 0 to 40/50% fluctuation in price during the next yearWeekly post is here: Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)Alma·August 24, 2025Last week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.Read full storyIt is very important to note that the momentum seems weak below the weekly centroid zone. This is a red flag, but only a faint red one. I wrote that the probability of risk window shifted to the post-FOMC/OpEx window, but it is not a 0-100% probability, but like 40-60%. My advice is always: never be married to a bias. And don’t expect me to tell you what this market will do exactly. Especially now. I’m unsure too. I only know what to watch, and when the picture clears out I will know… For now we must watch how things evolve around momentum is evolving around key zones. And knowing what the key zones mark, we can gain informations about the momentum. This is why I don’t take any longer-term positions yet.The mean reversion signal from last week is there. Market is at extremes. And risk probability is way above 0%, but lower than a potential Sept risk window. I explained this in the weekly post. So keep your eyes open. Structure is supported. For now, there is no catalyst on the horizont for a sell-off/breaking through the vol based structure. But the market’s main bet is ranging with a slight positive drift not a rally or a sell-off. Keep your eyes open for longer-term trades, and wait for NVDA ER, market is very concentrated.As said: market is not always predictable. Now, this is the time to watch and read the tape until the momentum clears out. This is the time for patience for people who want to take long-term positions.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.
