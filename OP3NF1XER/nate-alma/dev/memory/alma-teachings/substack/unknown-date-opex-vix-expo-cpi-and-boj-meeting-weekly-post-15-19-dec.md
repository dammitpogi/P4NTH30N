Market analysisOpEx, VIX expo, CPI and BoJ meeting - Weekly post (15-19/Dec)Dec 14, 2025∙ Paid203ShareI dropped a post about Bitcoin outlook and strategy for the next 5 year window:Bitcoin analysis for the next 5 yearsAlma·December 3, 2025Read full storyLiquidityMarket is just trading at fair value and it is very carefully managed so that the weekly avg returns does not exceed too much the monthly ones. Statistically the first half of December is usually flat-to-negative in terms of performance, while the second half it steps into a steep positive phase. We can see problems in the economy and growing uncertainity about valuation in the tech sector, with rotation into value assets, but I don’t expect it to have immediate impact. Mostly into late-Q1/Q2 next year with other policy shocks.Growth scare is off the table, as market is positive that the Fed will support the economy for any cost. More like they welcome slowdown as it gives more room for future stimulus and easing cycle, just as bonds and stocks tells; bad news is good news.Last week, on Friday the profit taking came one day later than I originally expected. But still market did not broke the structure. The only important thing, liquidity-wise is a gap below us at 6765.89 - 6783.87, that should be retested in order to provide more stability and confidence for an EoM rally. As long as this gap holds on the daily, the path of least resistance remains to the upside towards 7000 and even beyond. We have VIX expo, M&QOpEx, NFP and retail sales on Tuesday, and CPI on Thursday, plus BoJ rate decision that effects carry trade. Market expects in-line or cooler-than-expected for now, that they welcome. However, a BoJ rate will likely affect risk sentiment, but more like after the OpEx week, and I don’t expect a too significant impact, as carry book isn’t that large however if the tone is more hawkish than expected, it can cause some trouble (but less odds, as their growth is kinda ok). SubscribeMarket is at equilibrium, no disbalance into any direction.The model says that any weekly close above 6622.49 makes it remain so. Market supports this zone heavily via vol selling, while betting on skew scalping on sentiment traps.
