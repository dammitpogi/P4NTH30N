Market analysisThe problems, Momentum, Fed, Stagflation + Intraday post (11/July)Jul 11, 2025∙ Paid1022ShareHere is my monthly and weekly post.And here is an educational post about trading principles. Next part is coming soon…And I also add, that the upward strenght is declining fast, while market breadth, put/call ratio and valuation metrics show extreme compliance. The problem is that the rally and markets at all-time-highs create leverage that will be used as collateral for more growth. This elevates household perceived net worth, creating positive wealth effect, that supports inflationary pressures even if underlying wages or incomes are unchanged.Meanwhile Trump, after extending the expiration dates of dozens of reciprocal tariffs into Aug 1, sent fresh tariff notifications to 23 countries, including Canada, Brazil, Japan and South Korea, detailing updated levies effective August 1.Don’t forget that tariffs serve to give Trump leverage to negotiate. Fed is divided on when to cut rates due to the tariff uncertainity. Powell signaled a lower threshold for easing if tariff shocks prove temporary, but they still want to see more softening in core inflation and jobs data first. Until, rates stay with us. As I code, the rate is aligns with what the Taylor-rate would implicate especially taking into account the recession risk. Because GDP growth is expected to slowdown more into year end (weakest since 2009). Stagflation is there. However, market expects at least one cut by EoY. After Trump renewed tariff storm, the Fed Funds moved a bit up on current rate levels, and went down on lower rates, still expect a cut. Also SPX/yields beta is slightly negative, that means that people want bad news to get rate cuts. And this is a major divergence in the sentiment.A clear footprint of manipulation by Bessent, and the insider group behind Trump (banks, funds, JPM, BlackRock, private funds, etc.).When market finds equilibrium, it will reverse sharply.SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
