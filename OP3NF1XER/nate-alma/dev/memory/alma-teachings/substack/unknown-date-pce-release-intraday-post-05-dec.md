Market is a bit uncertain about how it should value the datas it has and tech of course. Trump wants to manage debt burden, Powell wants to manage inflation. On the short-run, the sentiment leans towards bad news are good news. So, market leans towards Trump’s pov, and wants stimulus on the short-run. Market is more concerned of growth. But needs confirmation in this sentiment by assuring investors that inflation will be managed and keeping rates lower is necessary.This is very well reflected in the price action, as spot just stopped at the primal weekly upside target, and now volatility starts to become more sensitive. For today, the market is still confidently selling puts, but not as confidently as before, while does not expect 6880/6900 to be broken this week. it shows a pattern that they fear the malign market reaction for a weak PCE print, while it would provide room for the Fed to cut (both in terms of growth metrics and market’s wealth effect wise… not too much tho, but more than nothing).This is why I said: pivotal window here.”Now, the following PCE number is the Sept data. October and November are missing. The Street’s expectation is core PCE ≈ 0.2–0.3% m/m, about 2.9% y/y, basically expecting it above 2% with a trend lower. Sentiment is tested and stays in “bad news are good news” and “good news are bad news”. Because market wants ‘room’ for the Fed to cut rates, as it is concerned of the potential hawkishness. Market wants a stable easing cycle. So a bad PCE and a bit of sell would be good for the markets. They are like “either the PCE will give teh Fed some room, or Fed will temper the sentiment”.Ok, how I play it?Well, I signaled dip buying on Nov 20, when SPX was at ~6540I said this week, when the spot touched the upside weekly pivot around 6860 to take some profit. I don’t bet on selloff, I rather like “either buy the dip, or hold the positions waiting for the Fed’s signal”. There is no place to gamble here. Macro is messy. I don’t expect headline grabbing big trades, also not expect catastrophic or any game-changer print, rather a supportive but rather ambiguous print. And the later Fed interpretations will be the key factors that can cause sentiment shifts. Targets are shared in the weeky post, and in the intraday post…SubscribeBut now lets jump into the daily positioning breakdown…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
