Market analysisGeo and policy uncertainity is here - Weekly post (10-14/Nov)Nov 09, 2025∙ Paid221ShareUpdated window of risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Alma·October 29, 2025Read full storyThe last weekThe SCOTUS hearing on Trump’s tariff authority (held Wednesday, Nov 5) was the week’s most consequential event for policy risk. Challening whether President Trump lawfully used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners and sanctions. Event futures prices 4:5 odds that Trump loses the case. A loss for Trump could mean the Treasury must refund billions in tariff revenue, worsening the fiscal deficit (we can expect like $130–140 billion in tariff refunds, that is like 0.5% of the US GDP). Of course, there would be procedural delays and perhaps political maneuvering. But this is something that the equitites do not price in. Trump also agreed to halve tariffs (from 20% to 10%) on Chinese imports and Xi promised to postpone its planned export restrictions on rare earth minerals for one year and committed to buy more U.S. agricultural products, in exchange. Also Switzerland might be close to getting US tariffs reduced.However, the fact that these are ad-hoc deals also injects some uncertainty – they’re not part of a coherent global framework, but rather Trump’s bilateral bargaining.Shutdowns… It not only caused the data issues noted earlier but also threatened to start tangibly dragging on the economy. Defense contractors were facing delays in payments, federal employees missed paychecks, and the FAA (air traffic control) staffing was so strained that the US Transportation Secretary warned of 20% flight cuts and even larger disruptions approaching Thanksgiving if the shutdown continued. NFP has also not been released. Trump decided to hold off on military action in Venezuela (against the russian ally Maduro) for now due to the Court hearing. Launching a war without Congress would raise another set of legal issues (War Powers Act). Trump might have calculated that opening two big legal fronts at once (tariffs in SCOTUS and a Venezuela intervention drawing court challenges) could be risky. SubscribeAll in all Trump’s hardball tactics (tariffs, shutdown threats) are backfiring, leaving him with less leverage and the market with more uncertainty. Look at the news: polls showed blame on leadership for the shutdown, and the election results (e.g. in Virginia, Ohio) were seen as a warning to Republicans to moderate.This is something that this 20-21x overvalued market does not price in properly. Too optimistic instead. Plus Fed made a hawkish cut, flattening the yield curve, tempering expectations for Dec, and pushing down front-end. The tariff hearing added to upward yield pressure, but market is optimistic on the medium run.Geopolitical fragmentation and tech AI now drive markets as much as, if not more than, the traditional business cycle. I remain pro-risk, specifically overweight US equities, because US companies (especially in tech) benefiting disproportionately from themes like AI.Hedges increased, dark pools showed no bid, uncertainity emerged during the week. If Trump keeps failing bringing certainity to the economy and markets, this gonna be bloody. This is the key…For now, I’m cautiously optimistic on the longer-run (yearly). Benefit from the US strength (aways from EU) and AI boom, but be aware that the world is volatile and it is changing. Favor quality bonds as hedges despite short-term yield pops.
