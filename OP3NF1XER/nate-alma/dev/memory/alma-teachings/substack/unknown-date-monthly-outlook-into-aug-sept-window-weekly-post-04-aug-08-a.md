Market analysisMonthly outlook into Aug - Sept window + Weekly post (04/Aug - 08/Aug)Aug/Sept window overview, Oil, Gold, Silver, BTC, SPXAug 03, 2025∙ Paid3724ShareA quick overview:SubscribeThis Aug-Sept window is pivotal for the US markets and economy as I keep saying since April.The problem is geo again…Trump finally recognized that he was sitting in a boiling water set by his political opponents in the US, and he is now in panic mode. He got everything he needed at the start, to build longterm alliances, but he got successfully trapped into a psychological reflexive control, as he is too impatient and pride. Geopolitical miscalculations and mistakes are possible to start to occure into/during the August OpEx week, that irreversibly destroy everything that is built til now. (This will also favor Musk to to rise…)Btw, I want to tell you one thing here… the timing of the tariffs are not as random as many thinks… one of my friend talked with me about Trump being extremely relied on astrology (most leaders are, btw). He told me, that according to Vedic astrology, from the second half of July, the western economy stepped into some specific planteray transits that can be read as windows for famine, financial instability, and holds until the end of November. This sets a favorable environment for any tariff-attacks for someone who believes in astro, these conditions may amplify the tariff effects on the opponents.Also his impatience is amplified because astrologically Trump will faces health, legal and political karmic challeneges going into September, with potential inner conflicts in the US. So, it is logical that he is trying to achieve as much as he can, and the prophecy can fulfill itself… Not a coincidence that Jim Simons also monitored closely the astrology because, many leaders rely on them, and also used as encrypted codes between funds and insider entities. This is why some researchers found fluctuating but significant correlation between lunar cycles and market cycles. The oil is expected to rise towards $80 and I speculate on further rise towards its 2022’s highs in the following months, as a result of tariffs. As you know, I’m bullish on gold and silver on the long-run, so is on bitcoin - not speculating on short-term noises here. No edge on that. I expect further geopolitical turmoils into the OpEx week on equities with further risk-off and sell. Then from the second half into Sept OpEx, I expect short-term rebound and a potential bulltrap to be built.
