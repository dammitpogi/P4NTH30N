Market analysisIntraday post (12/May)May 12, 2025∙ Paid921ShareUS- ChinaThe 90-day pause in U.S.–China tariffs represents a truce to halt escalating duties and buy time for negotiations until Washington and Beijing agree next steps. This pause freezes further escalation, clearing away “noise” so negotiations can proceed without daily headline shocks. Final outcomes now depend on bilateral diplomacy, not unilateral tariff hikes. U.S. equities jumped roughly 3–4% on the pause news, lifting the S&P 500 to fresh highs within days. Quant models and momentum-based funds use measured-move targets; once that objective was reached, buying interest naturally waned. Fast moves tend to exhaust one-way flows, increasing the odds of a corrective pullback that “cools off” excessive valuations.After an up-move, a base forms when supply and demand find equilibrium, often accompanied by declining volume, creating a launchpad for a sustainable advance. Prices trading sideways within a defined corridor signal indecision and allow volume and volatility to normalize before a breakout. A retracement off the high can help wash out weaker hands and test key support levels without invalidating the uptrend. Once a pullback establishes a higher-low above critical support, buyers regain confidence for the next push—avoiding “blow-off” tops.5760 is critical pivot momentum wise for SPX, and bullish until 5580, same with 5783 for ES=F, and 5590. Momentum wise!For more quantitatively computed ranges, check the weekly post.NO HIGH CONVICTION LONG YET… not rushingI see that I need to explain it again. As many of you know, I short VIX, short vol, and long delta for a while as a “hedge” while the risk/reward is on the short side.
