Market analysisOpEx week, China risk - Weekly post (13 - 17/Oct)Oct 12, 2025∙ Paid2411ShareExplaining my Window of Risk call:Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tellsAlma·September 18, 2025Read full storyIn my last weekly post, I expected Monday-Tuesday stability and grind-up with looming risk, and volatility risk into the second half of the week with downside target of 6514.36Trump announced an extra 100% tariff on Chinese imports, with an intended start date of Nov 1, 2025 (on top of existing tariffs), and vowed new export controls on “critical” U.S. software. (funny enough that I market November as my next window of risk target, during the summer…)I spent April to explain you the geo situation and the motives of the sides. There I explained that this war won’t be over soon. It is a serious battle, Trump and Xi are prepared. However, note that I don’t expect serious escalation until next spring.China’s Ministry of Transport announced a special port service fee on US-built/owned/flagged/operated vessels calling at Chinese ports, effective Tue, Oct 14. MOFCOM and GAC issued new controls on some medium/heavy rare-earth-related items and technologies, with implementation dates in November/December depending on the annex. Also the State Administration for Market Regulation opened an antitrust probe tied to Qualcomm’s Autotalks deal. The interesting thing is the same pattern I saw in April… that yields spiked during the after-hour or asian trading session after yields crushing moves. This makes me think that China is quietly, deliberately selling US treasuries. Including the offshore custodians, China still holds around US approximately $1.8‑1.9 trillion in US bonds.While officially it is down by 6.44% and hit the lowest level since 2008. But I emphatize, that Beijing has hidden reserves held through offshore custodians (Euroclear in Belgium, Clearstream in Luxembourg) and state‑owned banks.So, they can treat with selling UST without significantly hurting themselves.China is preparing to inflict asymmetric pain on US high‑tech industries via rare-earth restrictions, and can target active pharmaceutical ingredients, battery components and clean‑energy inputs (e.g., graphite) that are difficult to substitute, in order to choke global supply chains. Also the State Council planned to review a roadmap for yuan‑backed stablecoins, with Hong Kong and Shanghai tasked to fast‑track the rollout, aiming to boost global adoption of the yuan. Such digital tokens could allow Chinese firms to settle international trade without touching the dollar. Also, they launched AxCNH, the world’s first regulated offshore yuan‑stablecoin in Kazakhstan, using technology from the Conflux blockchain network. These are the potential headline risks and responses from China to counter US pressure. SubscribeLet’s look at the OpEx positioning…WEEKLY POSITIONINGHere you can see the weekly positioning: This is a net positive speed profile, also we have net long vanna and net short charm into the Friday expo. I don’t see convexity shifts, so no fly pattern on the horizont. This speed profile means, that to the upside the gamma is increasing, and it is decreasing to the downside. The steepness is not too significant. Making it easier for the spot to climb upward, but volatility should be sold, telling us that the spot ‘accepts the environment’. This comes hand in hand with longer vanna profile, meaning that mechanically the dealer profile becomes longer vega if price climbs upward, making them to sell volatility. And if volatility is sold, they become shorter delta, making them to buy futures supporting the spot to the upside. Meanwhile, negative charm flow makes dealers shorter delta as time passes, generating a relatively weak passive buyback flow into the OpEx. This flow will be significant on Thursday and Friday. SubscribeThe net gamma and net vega exposures of the profile are both negative.So this creates a very vol-sensitive (“left-tail sensitive”) positioning. This is mitigated a bit by the net long color (gamma decay) exposure, but I estimate only a 16-17% gamma increase over the week, still remaining in the negative territory. The profile is also long veta and short vomma. And this is a very important part!The long veta (vega decay) profile creates a passive and decreasing vol selling flow into Wednesday. VIX pin at 21s is very likely into VIX expo, but I will reassume it on Tuesday. However the short vomma (gamma of vega) exposure makes the profile even more sensitive to vol squeezes. (Below, I share the areas that the profile implies for vol crush and vol squeeze) However, the most important part of the profile for me is, that we are in long zomma territory! And it is even longer to the downside. Zomma is the gamma change to volatility. It is only positive at the very tails. It means vol up/gamma up, vol down/gamma down. This is a mathematically inbuilt mechanism, because the system is designed to not let volatility to be squeezed to infinity, or to be crushed to zero. Because if vol spikes, downside gammas will go up as well, flattening the speed profile and generating a “brake” effect to the downside through long gamma hedging (trading futures against the direction compressing the intraday realized returns). When I see long zomma, it always tells me that market expects that the spot reached the very tails of the local curve on the scrutinized tenor. In this case, this is the left-tail: (just imagine the functions pushed lower on the y-axis until the gamma and vomma curves reaches negative territory)This is why I don’t see the fly pattern, because the center would be even more higher, where vanna and speed shift to negative.So this tells me, that the market doesn’t expect more downside, unless more macro trigger (China) occurs. If it does, sub-6400 is the target.
