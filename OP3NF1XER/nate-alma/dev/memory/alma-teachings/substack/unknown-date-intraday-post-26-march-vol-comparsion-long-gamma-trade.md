Market analysisIntraday post (26/march), vol comparsion, long gamma tradebear trap and bull trap into Rosh Chodesh Nisan?Mar 26, 2025∙ Paid1753ShareIn this weekly post I convered the base, initial context that we should take as the initial point when we are making comparsions or monitoring the changes. Also convered the JPM collar hedge. Recent indications suggest that the “bear‑case” for tariffs is being moderated. If tangible tariff details are released on 2nd of April, there can be significant clarity for corporate planning.

Besides call selling, we can see some significant increase on the tails even compared to yesterday: But call selling is coming back into EOM expo: For bulls, it is very important to hold’n’close above 5710.25 into the weekend in order to not let downside vol to get realized… I’ll tell you why I smell bear trap here, but now… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
