<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Macro is a timeline of constraints</h3>
<p>
  Macro is not “a story.” It is a set of constraints that changes what is possible for markets:
  growth vs inflation, fiscal policy, central bank reaction functions, geopolitical shocks,
  and liquidity conditions.
</p>

<h3>Rates and the valuation regime</h3>
<p>
  Many market regimes can be described by what drives rates and how equities correlate with yields.
  When that correlation flips, the meaning of “good news” changes.
</p>

<h3>Headlines vs. actions (why tape can ignore “good news”)</h3>
<p>
  A repeated theme in the corpus is that markets react to <em>concrete actions</em>, not tweets or
  promises. In stressed regimes, headline flow can dominate the tape, but the market still selects
  which headlines matter by translating them into constraints (supply chains, tariffs, policy, war).
</p>

<h3>“Hidden QE” and correlation as a sentiment gauge</h3>
<p>
  The “Bessent put / hidden QE” concept is framed as a concealed support mechanism that sustains
  artificial growth via equity–yield correlation dynamics. The practical use is as a gauge for how
  the market will decode the next data print: as a growth shock or as a rates/financial-conditions
  shock.
</p>

<h3>Geopolitics is an options market</h3>
<p>
  Geopolitical risk often shows up first as oil convexity, skew demand, and risk-premium hedging.
  The market pays for tails before the headlines become obvious.
</p>

<h3>Stagflation is a constraint stack</h3>
<p>
  Several notes explicitly connect geopolitics (war risk, tariffs, supply disruptions) to a
  stagflationary constraint set: higher inflation pressure alongside weaker growth, with second-
  order impacts flowing through rates, risk premium, and liquidity.
</p>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>

<h3>Event-pressure checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>List upcoming events (CPI/PCE/NFP/FOMC/OpEx).</li>
  <li>State the impact channel (rates, vol, liquidity, risk premium).</li>
  <li>State the likely behavior (suppression, range expansion, breakout risk).</li>
  <li>Adapt sizing: event proximity should change risk, not your ego.</li>
</ol>

<h3>A “macro to trade” translation loop</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Write the constraint:</strong> is the week dominated by growth, inflation, policy, or geopolitics?</li>
  <li><strong>Check correlation:</strong> is equity–yield correlation currently acting as tailwind or headwind?</li>
  <li><strong>Locate the tail market:</strong> where are tails being bought (oil, gold skew, vol products)?</li>
  <li><strong>Map second-order links:</strong> oil → inflation → yields → equity valuation/risk premium.</li>
  <li><strong>Define invalidation:</strong> what observation would tell you the constraint story is wrong?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using macro narratives to justify a trade after the fact.</li>
  <li>Ignoring second-order effects (oil → inflation → rates → equities).</li>
  <li>Trading “headline shock” without defining invalidation.</li>
  <li>Believing the market must react to a headline instead of watching how it reacts.</li>
  <li>Ignoring correlation/beta shifts that change what “good news” means.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Can you explain what “term premium” is and why it matters for risk assets?</li>
  <li>What does “stagflation” do to equities and bonds in a typical regime?</li>
  <li>How would you detect geopolitical tail hedging in market data?</li>
</ol>
