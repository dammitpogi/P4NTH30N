<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<p>
  The archive is your “case law.” It is not the curriculum itself; it is the evidence set. Use it
  to see how the doctrine is applied under real conditions.
</p>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>
<h3>Weekly posts first, intraday posts second</h3>
<p>
  Weekly posts typically frame structure and regime. Intraday posts typically provide timing,
  confirmations, and concrete levels.
</p>

<h3>Make your own flashcards</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the pivot, targets, and invalidation.</li>
  <li>Write the regime state and event pressure.</li>
  <li>After the fact, grade process (did confirmations/invalidation work?), not just PnL.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to read a daily post (outline)</h3>
<p>
  The goal is not to stare at lagging indicators. The goal is to reverse-engineer what structure the
  market is pricing, then use levels as checkpoints to interpret price action.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Premarket heatmap:</strong> get the positioning map (where flows likely matter).</li>
  <li><strong>Script inputs:</strong> pivots, targets, and probability checkpoints (upside/downside).</li>
  <li><strong>Speed profile:</strong> the expected drift and whether mechanics are suppressive/supportive.</li>
  <li><strong>Vanna flip / speed slip:</strong> the regime-change conditions (what breaks the current path).</li>
</ol>

<h3>A disciplined intraday workflow</h3>
<p>
  Most days you only have one true edge opportunity (two at most). The skill is waiting.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Watch the first 30-40 minutes; let the market build and retest a structure.</li>
  <li>Define your daily budget: loss limit and profit limit.</li>
  <li>Pick one side you understand (long/short) and define entry conditions + size.</li>
  <li>Write the invalidation first, take the loss when invalidated, and do not "revenge trade".</li>
  <li>If the setup doesn't show up, leave it for tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reading old posts as “predictions” rather than as examples of a method.</li>
  <li>Ignoring the event calendar context (CPI/FOMC/OpEx) that made the day behave that way.</li>
  <li>Cherry-picking only the wins and skipping the disciplined invalidations.</li>
  <li>Taking every printed level as a signal instead of using levels as checkpoints.</li>
  <li>Overtrading the open (0DTE noise) instead of waiting for structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Can you summarize the weekly thesis in 3 bullets before reading intraday posts?</li>
  <li>Can you extract pivot + confirmation + invalidation from a post without adding numbers?</li>
  <li>Can you grade a day on process (rules followed), not outcome (PnL)?</li>
</ol>
