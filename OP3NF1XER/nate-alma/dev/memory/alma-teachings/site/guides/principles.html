<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Trading is decision-making under uncertainty</h3>
<p>
  Your goal is not to “be right.” Your goal is to repeatedly make decisions where the expected
  outcome is positive after costs, and where the losing path is survivable.
</p>

<h3>Analysis method: positioning + price action</h3>
<p>
  A practical synthesis: positioning/volatility structure helps define the probability distribution
  and key zones, while realized price action decides timing and whether the market is accepting or
  rejecting those zones.
</p>

<h3>Technical analysis vs. positioning analysis (a false debate)</h3>
<p>
  The corpus treats this debate as unnecessary: technical analysis guesses liquidity zones and
  probabilities from historical data, while positioning analysis increases confidence by explaining
  the meaning behind levels and the current market environment. Micro-cycles are driven by the
  volatility market; realized patterns still dictate timing.
</p>

<h3>Position sizing is the real strategy</h3>
<p>
  Two traders can take the same entry and have opposite outcomes depending on sizing and exits.
  The Kelly criterion is a way to connect edge and payout to an “optimal” growth fraction.
  Most humans should use a fraction of Kelly to reduce drawdown risk.
</p>

<h3>Expected value beats “being right”</h3>
<p>
  One explicit warning in the corpus: most traders fail not because their directional accuracy is
  low, but because they lack a consistent strategy and discipline, and they size poorly. A good
  decision can lose; a bad decision can win. The goal is positive expected value after costs.
</p>

<h3>Fair bet (why “neutral” doesn’t mean “safe”)</h3>
<p>
  The “fair bet” idea is introduced as: when expected value over many bets is exactly zero, neither
  side has an edge. In trading, you still pay costs and you still face variance. So “fair” is not a
  comfort blanket; it’s the baseline you must beat.
</p>

<h3>Furus vs. analysts (how people get trapped)</h3>
<p>
  A practical teaching in the corpus: novices prefer gurus because they give simple, actionable
  statements. Analysts often explain dynamics without a single “do this now” call. The trap is
  outsourcing thinking (copy-trading) instead of owning a process and validating claims.
</p>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>

<h3>A risk-first template for any trade</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> What must be true for this trade to work?</li>
  <li><strong>Invalidation:</strong> Where is it clearly wrong?</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> How much do you lose if invalidated?</li>
  <li><strong>Reward:</strong> What is a realistic target (not the dream target)?</li>
  <li><strong>Size:</strong> Choose size so loss is acceptable and repeatable.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Two “anti-ruin” rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Never add risk to repair ego.</strong> If you want to “win it back,” your size is already too large.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop trading when the process breaks.</strong> A losing streak is information; enforce a stop rule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why “working people” need a different approach</h3>
<p>
  If you have limited screen time, you can’t fight professionals on speed. You win by selecting
  fewer, higher-quality decisions, sizing safely, and avoiding emotional overtrading.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Changing your rules after a loss (reinforcing bad behavior).</li>
  <li>Overtrading to “win it back.”</li>
  <li>Confusing a good outcome with a good decision.</li>
  <li>Taking small wins and large losses (negative expectancy disguised as activity).</li>
  <li>Optimizing for accuracy instead of expectancy (risk/reward + base rates).</li>
  <li>Copy-trading “furus” without understanding the model, costs, and risk constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Do you know your maximum loss per trade (in dollars) before you enter?</li>
  <li>Can you describe Kelly sizing in plain language?</li>
  <li>Can you explain the difference between technical analysis and positioning analysis?</li>
  <li>What is your rule for stopping after a losing streak?</li>
  <li>Can you explain what a “fair bet” is, and why costs make it negative for you?</li>
</ol>
