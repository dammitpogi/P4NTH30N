<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Each asset has its own “personality”</h3>
<p>
  Index futures (ES/SPX), gold, bitcoin, and bonds respond to different constraints. The same macro
  shock can create opposite reactions depending on what the asset represents (growth, safety,
  liquidity hedge, term premium).
</p>

<h3>“Structure” matters more than headlines</h3>
<p>
  A recurring theme across the corpus is to watch whether price can <em>build structure</em> around a
  key pivot zone. If structure cannot be built above/below a pivot, the path is treated as fragile,
  even when narratives sound strong.
</p>

<h3>Correlation is a regime variable (not a constant)</h3>
<p>
  Cross-asset behavior often changes when correlations change. A concrete example in the corpus is
  when rates/equity correlation becomes “less hostile” as rates volatility slides back toward
  calmer ranges; that alters how equity reacts to data and to yield moves.
</p>

<h3>Bitcoin: trade vs. investment (and why it consolidates)</h3>
<p>
  Bitcoin is repeatedly framed less as an intraday “setup engine” and more as an investment vehicle
  in regimes where its fundamentals and market structure are still evolving. A specific observed
  behavior: one large move toward a target, followed by multi-week range-bound consolidation.
</p>

<h3>Cross-asset correlation is the hidden risk</h3>
<p>
  Many losses come from correlation shifts, not from “being wrong” on direction. When correlations
  flip, your hedges can fail.
</p>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>

<h3>A simple cross-asset map</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Equities:</strong> discount-rate + earnings expectations + positioning mechanics.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonds/yields:</strong> inflation expectations + term premium + central bank reaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Gold:</strong> real rates + risk premium + reserve/flow demand; can also be speculative.</li>
  <li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> liquidity conditions + risk appetite + narrative reflexivity; behaves in regimes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A practical “asset checklist” (15 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Define the driver:</strong> today is mainly rates, growth, inflation, geopolitics, or positioning mechanics.</li>
  <li><strong>Mark the pivots:</strong> identify the key pivot zone(s) that decide whether structure can be built.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask what is underpriced:</strong> is the next event risk underpriced (data, earnings, OpEx/VIX expo)?</li>
  <li><strong>Watch correlation:</strong> is rates/equity correlation behaving “hostile” or “supportive” in this regime?</li>
  <li><strong>Adapt sizing:</strong> if the regime is fragile, treat any directional bet as tactical and smaller.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to read cross-asset “risk hedging” signals</h3>
<p>
  A repeated tell is that hedging demand shows up where convexity is easiest to buy (or least
  painful to hold). In the corpus, gold skew inversion is explicitly called out as a sign that
  investors are hedging macro risk.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assuming bitcoin trades like equities in every regime.</li>
  <li>Believing gold only responds to geopolitics (rates matter).</li>
  <li>Ignoring FX effects when your base currency is not USD.</li>
  <li>Trading narratives while ignoring whether the market is building structure at pivots.</li>
  <li>Assuming hedges will work the same way after correlation flips.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>When yields rise, what are the two main channels for equity impact?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between nominal yields and real yields for gold?</li>
  <li>What regime would you expect bitcoin to underperform?</li>
</ol>
