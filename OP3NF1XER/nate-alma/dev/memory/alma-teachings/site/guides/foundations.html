<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Determinism vs. probability (why trading is not chess)</h3>
<p>
  A deterministic system is one where the same inputs always produce the same outputs. Markets are
  not deterministic because they are made of humans, incentives, feedback loops, and changing
  constraints. The correct mental model is probabilistic: you manage distributions, not certainties.
</p>

<h3>Emergence (why “good enough” models can still work)</h3>
<p>
  The corpus frames determinism as a macro-level simplification: complex systems contain many
  hidden variables, yet repeated patterns can emerge at the aggregate level. This is why traders
  can use models as approximations while still respecting uncertainty and tail risk.
</p>

<h3>Probability is not a feeling</h3>
<p>
  When a trader says “high probability,” they should mean: “Given my model and the current regime,
  this outcome occurs more often than alternatives, and the payoff is worth the risk.”
  A strategy can be profitable while losing frequently if the wins are larger than the losses.
</p>

<h3>Volatility is a liquidity signal</h3>
<p>
  Volatility is commonly treated as “price moves a lot,” but the usable definition is tighter:
  volatility is the annualized standard deviation of log returns. In practice, volatility behaves
  like a proxy for how hard it is for buyers and sellers to meet at a price (liquidity).
</p>

<h3>Realized vs. implied volatility (how the market prices distributions)</h3>
<p>
  The corpus repeatedly treats volatility objects as a translation layer: implied volatility embeds
  forward-looking risk premia and the market’s priced distribution, while realized volatility is
  backward-looking. Learning to map between them is part of learning “probability” in practice.
</p>

<h3>Efficient markets vs. deviations (momentum and mean reversion)</h3>
<p>
  Efficient Market Hypothesis is introduced as a baseline, then contrasted with empirical
  deviations like momentum and mean reversion. The point is not to pick a religion, but to know
  which behavior tends to dominate in which regime.
</p>

<h3>Risk is measurable</h3>
<p>
  You will repeatedly see professional risk language: VaR, beta, Sharpe, Sortino. These are not
  decorations. They are ways of translating “this feels risky” into “this can lose X under Y
  assumptions.”
</p>

<h3>Reflexivity (why narratives can move fundamentals)</h3>
<p>
  Reflexivity is the idea that beliefs and prices can change behavior, and that behavior can change
  the world the beliefs were trying to describe. It explains bubbles, crashes, and why “price is
  information.”
</p>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>

<h3>A beginner’s trading decision loop</h3>
<ol>
  <li>State your hypothesis as a distribution: what outcomes are plausible, and what would confirm them?</li>
  <li>Define your invalidation first: where does your hypothesis become wrong?</li>
  <li>Size the position so the invalidation loss is acceptable.</li>
  <li>Only then choose entry mechanics (levels, timing, execution).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Two rules that prevent blowups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Never confuse “likely” with “certain.”</strong> Certainty is how you oversize.</li>
  <li><strong>Never trade without an invalidation.</strong> No invalidation = no defined risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Foundations-to-trade checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>State the distribution:</strong> what outcomes are plausible and what is the base rate?</li>
  <li><strong>Name the regime:</strong> are you in momentum, mean reversion, or “fragile” volatility conditions?</li>
  <li><strong>Define the tail:</strong> what would qualify as an “event” in this environment?</li>
  <li><strong>Price the risk:</strong> are you being paid enough (expected value) to take it?</li>
  <li><strong>Write invalidation:</strong> where is the hypothesis wrong, in observable terms?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a chart as if it predicts the future, instead of describing current constraints.</li>
  <li>Using volatility as a mood indicator rather than a risk/liquidity metric.</li>
  <li>Thinking “fundamentals” are separate from “price.” In reflexive regimes they are linked.</li>
  <li>Ignoring base rates (how often this setup works) and focusing on a single example.</li>
  <li>Treating EMH, momentum, or mean reversion as always-on instead of regime-dependent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Can you explain in one sentence why markets are probabilistic systems?</li>
  <li>What is your difference between “edge” and “confidence”?</li>
  <li>What does volatility measure mathematically (not poetically)?</li>
  <li>What is reflexivity, and how would you recognize it in a bubble?</li>
  <li>Can you explain realized vs implied volatility without using the word “prediction”?</li>
</ol>
