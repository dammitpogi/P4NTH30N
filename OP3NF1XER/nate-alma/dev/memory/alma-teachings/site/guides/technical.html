<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Levels are checkpoints, not predictions</h3>
<p>
  In this doctrine, pivots and targets are used as checkpoints to interpret the market’s internal
  state. A pivot is a line-in-the-sand: above it, one distribution dominates; below it, another.
</p>

<h3>Confirmation and invalidation are mandatory</h3>
<p>
  A level is only useful if it changes your behavior. “Confirmation” means the market accepts a
  scenario. “Invalidation” means it doesn’t. Without this, levels become superstition.
</p>

<h3>Daily posts as a structured read</h3>
<p>
  A disciplined daily read extracts: event pressure, pivot zones, targets, and the flow/volatility
  story that explains why those levels matter.
</p>

<h3>Reverse-engineering beats lagging indicators</h3>
<p>
  The corpus explicitly warns that common retail dashboards (put/call deltas, ratios, and even
  “order flow” deltas) are lagging data. The alternative method described is to reverse-engineer
  the structure the market is pricing in, decode hidden patterns (e.g., butterflies and
  risk-reversal patterns), and derive pivot ranges plus the implied distribution being priced.
</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a daily post (what to extract)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Premarket OptionsDepth heatmap</strong> (context / where liquidity matters).</li>
  <li><strong>Script inputs</strong> (levels with assigned probabilities).</li>
  <li><strong>Speed profile</strong> (the expected drift / pressure).</li>
  <li><strong>Regime-change flags</strong> (vanna flip and “speed slip”).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Expectations vs. behavior (where the edge is)</h3>
<p>
  A practical pattern used throughout the intraday notes is to compare what was expected for the
  week/day vs how the market actually behaves:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If behavior matches expectation, volatility tends to stay controlled (easy read, even if bearish).</li>
  <li>If behavior moves above expectation, sentiment is “out of control,” reinforcing the trend.</li>
  <li>If behavior diverges from expectation, it’s the strongest signal (but still needs confirmation).</li>
</ol>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>

<h3>How to read a daily post (in 5 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What is the event pressure today/this week?</li>
  <li>What is the main pivot range?</li>
  <li>What confirms upside vs downside?</li>
  <li>Where is invalidation?</li>
  <li>What is the expected behavior (suppression, rangebound, trend day)?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Turn levels into a decision (not a prediction)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pre-commit the invalidation:</strong> decide what would make you exit <em>before</em> entry.</li>
  <li><strong>Separate targets:</strong> treat targets as checkpoints (information), not take-profit fantasies.</li>
  <li><strong>Track structure:</strong> ask “is the market building structure at the pivot?” not “did it touch?”</li>
  <li><strong>Require confirmation:</strong> do not treat a bias as a trade until confirmations print.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anchoring on one number instead of treating a zone as a zone.</li>
  <li>Forgetting that the same level can act differently in different regimes.</li>
  <li>Confusing “support held once” with “support is guaranteed.”</li>
  <li>Using lagging indicators as if they reveal the current structure.</li>
  <li>Skipping confirmation/invalidation and calling it “discretion.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Can you explain what a pivot is in one sentence?</li>
  <li>Can you define “downside confirmation” vs “downside target”?</li>
  <li>What changes in your plan when volume is low and flows dominate?</li>
</ol>
