<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Options as a positioning map</h3>
<p>
  Options markets create mechanical hedging flows. When those flows are large relative to available
  liquidity, they can dominate price behavior. This is why “dealer positioning” matters.
</p>

<h3>Key Greeks (practical meaning)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delta:</strong> directional exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>Gamma:</strong> how fast delta changes; it drives hedging intensity near key strikes.</li>
  <li><strong>Vega:</strong> sensitivity to implied volatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Charm / Vanna:</strong> flows that arise as time passes and as vol changes; these often explain
    “pinning,” suppression, or sudden release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>OpEx / VIX expo (mechanical weeks)</h3>
<p>
  Expiry cycles change which strikes matter and how hedging behaves. In some weeks, macro news is
  secondary to mechanical flows.
</p>

<h3>Speed profile (the drift behind the noise)</h3>
<p>
  A “speed profile” is the doctrine’s way to describe how positioning pressure tends to push price
  over the session (and where it tends to resist). It is not a guarantee; it is an expected drift
  map that must be validated by price action.
</p>

<h3>Supportive vs. suppressive flows are context-dependent</h3>
<p>
  The corpus repeatedly warns against simplistic takes like “vanna is supportive” or “charm is
  suppressive.” Passive flows can be overwritten by other exposures, and net speed alone does not
  uniquely determine vanna/charm impact because weights differ across strikes and tenors.
</p>

<h3>Vomma supply (how volatility spikes are capped)</h3>
<p>
  “Vomma selling” is described as a way to dampen volatility spikes by compressing the kurtosis of
  the distribution. It does not remove intraday swings; it changes how tails behave and where a
  true squeeze threshold (“event horizon of the tail”) sits.
</p>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>

<h3>Reading a “flow week” like a professional</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Identify the event calendar (CPI/FOMC/OpEx/VIX expo).</li>
  <li>Identify the pivot zone where mechanics change (often near major strikes).</li>
  <li>Define confirmation and invalidation levels (price acceptance vs rejection).</li>
  <li>Assume intraday reversals are possible even inside the same larger regime.</li>
</ol>

<h3>A practical “mechanics day” workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Start with the regime:</strong> is the tape mechanically controlled (pinning / suppression) or unstable?</li>
  <li><strong>Mark the pivot zone:</strong> the line-in-the-sand where drift behavior changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Watch the speed profile:</strong> does price action match the expected drift or diverge?</li>
  <li><strong>Respect the calendar:</strong> OpEx/VIX expo weeks can overpower narratives.</li>
  <li><strong>Trade confirmations:</strong> only size up once confirmations print; cut quickly on invalidation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Negative speed example (why it’s not “just bearish”)</h3>
<p>
  One schematic example in the corpus: a negative speed profile can coexist with positive charm and
  negative vanna (depending on exposures). That combination can generate liquidity to the downside
  while preventing downside vol squeezes and leaving the market vulnerable to upside squeezes.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assuming price action is “pure sentiment” when it is mechanical hedging.</li>
  <li>Ignoring expiry calendar and then being surprised by pinning/whipsaw.</li>
  <li>Forgetting that the regime can flip when a key strike/pivot breaks.</li>
  <li>Thinking “supportive/suppressive” is absolute instead of context-dependent.</li>
  <li>Treating Greek words as magic rather than mapping them to conditions + validation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Check</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What does positive vs negative gamma generally imply for intraday behavior?</li>
  <li>Why can OpEx weeks look “controlled” even when macro risk is high?</li>
  <li>What is a pivot level in this doctrine (not in generic charting)?</li>
  <li>In plain language, what does “vomma supply” try to do to tails?</li>
</ol>
