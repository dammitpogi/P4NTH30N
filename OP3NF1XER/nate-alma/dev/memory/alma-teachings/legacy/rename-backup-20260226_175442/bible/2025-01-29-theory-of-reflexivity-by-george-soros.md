Free Insights | Market ReportsTheory of Reflexivity by George SorosA very important lecture from 2009Jan 28, 20262422ShareBack in last May, I already shared George Soros’s lecture after explaining multiple times since 2025 February why the 2025 April crash was the first sign of a changing world order, “weighing machine turned on”. And I keep referencing to this every week. Without this theory, it is simply impossible to understand how the cycles work, and to ‘mentally zoom out” of the everyday noise.This post is a note/semi-transcript of his 2009 lecture at Central European University, Budapest (which I was fortunate to attend, as around this time I started to build my portfolio) with some additional annotations from me, where he outlines his theories of fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principle as they apply to financial markets. INTRODUCTIONToday I’ll apply the concepts I introduced yesterday—fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principle—to the financial markets. Please brace yourselves, because I’ll pack a lifetime of experience into this one lecture. The financial markets provide an excellent laboratory for testing the ideas I put forward in abstract form yesterday. The course of events in markets is easier to observe than in most other places. Many of the facts take a quantitative form, and the data are well recorded and well preserved.The opportunity for testing occurs because my interpretation of financial markets directly contradicts the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). That prevailing theory claims that markets naturally move toward equilibrium, and any deviations from equilibrium occur in a random fashion attributable to extraneous shocks. If the efficient market theory is valid, then my theory of reflexivity is false – and vice versa. SubscribeTWO PRINCIPLESLet me state the two cardinal principles of my conceptual framework as it applies to financial markets:First: Market prices always distort the underlying fundamentals. In other words, prices never perfectly reflect the real economic values. (The degree of distortion may vary from negligible to significant.) This is in direct contradiction to the efficient market hypothesis, which maintains that market prices accurately reflect all available information.Second: Instead of playing a purely passive role as a reflection of reality, financial markets can also actively influence the fundamentals they are supposed to reflect. In other words, market realities and market participants’ perceptions can influence each other. Prices do not merely mirror fundamentals; they can shape them.There are various pathways by which the mispricing of financial assets can occur. The most widely traveled are those which involve the use of leverage, both debt and equity leveraging. The various feedback loops may give the impression that markets are often right, but the mechanism at work is very different from the one proposed by the prevailing paradigm.I claim that financial markets have ways of altering the fundamentals, and that may bring about a closer correspondence between market prices and the underlying fundamentals. Contrast that with the efficient market hypothesis, which claims that markets are always accurately reflecting reality and automatically tend towards equilibrium.These two propositions focus our attention on reflexive feedback loops that often characterize financial markets. There are two kinds of feedback: negative feedback (which is self-correcting) and positive feedback (which is self-reinforcing). Negative feedback tends to push a system toward equilibrium (stabilizing it), while positive feedback pushes it away from equilibrium, producing dynamic disequilibrium. Positive feedback loops are more interesting because they can produce big moves in both market prices and the underlying fundamentals.A positive feedback process, if allowed to run its full course, is initially self-reinforcing (prices and fundamentals move further and further in one direction), but eventually it reaches a climax or reversal point, after which the process becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction. However, positive feedback processes don’t necessarily run to completion – they may be aborted at any time by negative feedback that corrects the course.BOOM AND BUST CYCLES AND BUBBLESI have developed a theory about boom–bust processes (i.e. bubbles) along these lines.Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality, and a misconception or false belief relating to that trend. A boom–bust process is set in motion when a trend and a misconception positively reinforce each other. The process is liable to be tested by episodes of negative feedback along the way. If the trend is strong enough to survive the tests, both the trend and the misconception will be further reinforced. Eventually, market expectations become so far removed from reality that people are forced to recognize that a misconception is involved. A “twilight period” then ensues, during which doubts grow and more people lose faith, even as the prevailing trend is sustained by inertia. As Chuck Prince, former head of Citigroup, said during the credit bubble: “We must continue dancing until the music stops.” Eventually a point is reached when the trend is reversed – it then becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction, as the boom turns into a bust.Let me go back to the example I used when I originally proposed my theory in 1987: the conglomerate boom of the late 1960s. The underlying trend in that case was represented by rising earnings per share for conglomerate companies, and the expectations (or misconception) relating to that trend were reflected in their stock prices. Conglomerates were improving their earnings per share by acquiring other companies. Inflated expectations actually allowed them to keep improving reported earnings – an example of reflexivity where perception (valuations) helped fuel the fundamental (earnings growth). But eventually, reality could not keep up with the market’s ever-increasing expectations. After a twilight period, the price trend was reversed. All the problems that had been swept under the carpet then surfaced, and earnings collapsed. As the president of one of the conglomerates, Ogden Corporation, told me at the time: “I have no audience to play to.”Typical Stages of a Bubble: Bubbles that conform to this boom–bust pattern go through a sequence of distinct stages:1) Inception: a new positive trend and misconception gain a foothold.2) Acceleration: the boom accelerates as belief in the trend grows.3) Testing: the boom is tested by negative feedback (e.g. a market dip), but if the positive trend is strong enough, it survives and reinforces further growth (a “successful test” of the bull market).4) Twilight period: growth slows and cracks begin to appear; skepticism rises, but inertia carries the trend forward (“we’re still dancing…”).5) Climax/Reversal: reality reasserts itself dramatically – the misconception is recognized and the trend reverses direction (peak of the bubble).6) Acceleration on the downside: the bust feeds on itself, often accelerated by forced liquidation of unsound positions (margin calls, redemptions, etc.).7) Crash/Crisis: the downward move culminates in a financial crisis and panic. Disillusionment turns into panic selling, reaching its extreme in the crisis moment.The length and strength of each stage is unpredictable, but there is an internal logic in the sequence of stages. So while we cannot predict when a bubble will peak or burst, the sequence of stages is in some sense predictable – unless some external negative feedback (say, government intervention) aborts the process at an earlier stage. In the case of the conglomerate boom, it was actually a specific event that constituted the climax: the defeat of Leasco Systems & Research Corporation in its attempted acquisition of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company (a major bank). That failure marked the end of the trend.My breakdown of the current bubble (that is not only on AI/tech) and its consequences can be found here: Market analysisThe challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significant—yet still underpriced—risk in the market.Read full storyTypically, bubbles have an asymmetric shape: the boom is long and drawn out, often slow to start and then accelerating gradually, flattening in the twilight period; the bust is short and steep, because it is reinforced by the frantic, forced liquidation of leveraged positions. In a bust, disillusionment turns into panic, which climaxes in a financial crisis.The simplest case is a real estate boom. The trend that precipitates it is that credit becomes cheaper and more easily available (interest rates fall, banks are eager to lend). The misconception is the belief that the value of the collateral (the real estate) is independent of the availability of credit. In reality, the relationship between the availability of credit and collateral value is reflexive: when credit becomes cheaper and more easily available, real estate activity picks up and property values rise; with prices rising and easy refinancing, there are fewer defaults, credit performance improves, and lenders feel safer – so lending standards are relaxed and even more credit flows to real estate. At the height of the boom, the amount of credit extended to the sector is maximal and prices are extremely high. Then a reversal hits: credit dries up, loans default, and forced sales of property drive real estate prices sharply down.Yet this misconception (that collateral value is independent of credit) continues to re-occur in various guises. For instance, the international banking crisis of 1982 revolved around sovereign debt (loans to countries) where no collateral was involved. The creditworthiness of sovereign borrowers was measured by various debt ratios – like debt-to-GDP and debt-service-to-exports. These ratios were treated as if they were objective indicators, while in fact they were reflexive: when lenders aggressively recycled petrodollars into loans to countries like Brazil in the 1970s, the influx of credit boosted those economies, so their debt ratios improved. That encouraged further lending, starting a new bubble cycle in sovereign debt. (And when the cycle reversed, those same debt ratios blew out, revealing the earlier optimism as false.)Not all bubbles involve the extension of credit; some are fueled by equity leverage. For example, the conglomerate boom of the 1960s and the Internet stock bubble of the late 1990s were fueled by equity leveraging – companies using inflated stock valuations to acquire others or finance ventures. When Alan Greenspan spoke about “irrational exuberance” in 1996, it misrepresented bubbles. When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire. That’s not irrational. And that’s why we need regulators to counteract the market when a bubble is threatening to grow too big—because we can’t rely on market participants, how well-informed and rational they are.Bubbles are not the only form in which reflexivity manifests itself. They are only the most dramatic and the most directly opposed to the efficient market hypothesis; therefore they deserve special attention. But reflexivity can take many other forms.In currency markets, for instance, the upside and downside are symmetrical, so there is no sign of an asymmetry between boom and bust; but there is no sign of equilibrium either. Freely floating exchange rates tend to move in large multi-year waves.Perhaps the most important reflexive interaction in markets is the ongoing interplay between financial authorities (central banks, regulators) and the markets themselves. Because markets do not tend toward equilibrium on their own, they are prone to produce periodic crises. Financial crises provoke regulatory reforms – that’s how central banking and financial regulation evolved in the first place. In this interplay, both the authorities and the market participants are acting on the basis of imperfect understanding, so their interaction is itself reflexive and unpredictable. While bubbles only occur intermittently, the interplay between authorities and markets is an ongoing process. Misunderstandings by either side usually stay within reasonable bounds because market reactions provide useful feedback to the authorities, allowing them to correct their mistakes. But occasionally, the mistakes prove to be self-validating, setting in motion vicious or virtuous circles.Such feedback loops resemble bubbles in the sense that they are initially self-reinforcing, but eventually self-defeating; but otherwise they take quite a different shape. SubscribeNOT ALL PRICE DISTORTIONS ARE REFLEXIVEIt is important to realize that not all price distortions are due to reflexivity. Market participants cannot base their decisions purely on knowledge of the present, because they have to anticipate the future – and the future is contingent on decisions people have not yet made! What those decisions will be, and what effect they will have, cannot be accurately anticipated. Nevertheless, people are forced to make guesses and decisions. To guess correctly, one would theoretically need to know every other participant’s future decisions and their consequences – which is impossible.Rational expectations theory in economics tried to get around this problem by assuming there is a single correct set of expectations about the future, and that people’s views will somehow converge on that correct expectation. That postulate has no resemblance to reality, yet it became the basis for much of financial economics as currently taught in universities. In practice, participants must make decisions in conditions of uncertainty. Their decisions are bound to be tentative and biased. That is the generic, everyday cause of most price distortions in markets.Occasionally, the price distortions set in motion a boom-bust process; more often, they are corrected by negative feedback before they spiral out of control. In these cases, market fluctuations appear random – I compare them to waves sloshing around in a swimming pool (small, oscillating, contained movements) as opposed to the tidal waves of a true bubble. The small waves are more  ubiquitous, while the big boom–bust tidal waves are relatively rare, but more significant. In reality, the two kinds of movements intermingle, so actual boom–bust episodes rarely follow the textbook-perfect sequence of my model – there are always cross-currents. True bubbles that dominate everything else are rare – they occur only when a positive feedback loop grows so powerful that it overshadows all other concurrent processes.It is useful to distinguish between near-equilibrium conditions and far-from-equilibrium situations in markets. Near-equilibrium conditions are characterized by humdrum, everyday events – many participants trading on diverse information, feedback mostly negative (self-correcting), price fluctuations looking like random noise. These everyday events are repetitive and lend themselves to statistical generalizations (quantitative models, probabilistic risk management, etc., work during normal times). Far-from-equilibrium situations, in contrast, arise when a bubble or other self-reinforcing process dominates. These give rise to unique, historical events (crashes, panics) where outcomes are highly uncertain and can disrupt the statistical patterns derived from normal times. The rules of thumb and risk models that work in near-equilibrium conditions do not apply in far-from-equilibrium situations. The recent global financial crisis (2007–2009) is a case in point. All the risk management tools and synthetic financial products that were premised on price deviations being random and self-correcting broke down during the crisis. People who relied on elegant mathematical models (which had served them well in near-equilibrium conditions) got badly hurt when the rare 100-year storm hit.INSIGHTS OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISISI have gained some new insights into far-from-equilibrium conditions during the recent crisis. As a participant in the markets, I had to act under immense time pressure in 2008, and I couldn’t gather all the information that would have been available under normal circumstances. The same was true for the regulatory authorities in charge – they were also operating with limited information and extreme urgency. That’s how far-from-equilibrium situations can spin out of control: events unfold faster than anyone can fully analyze, and decisions have to be made on imperfect information- very important.This phenomenon is not confined to financial markets. I experienced a similar thing during the collapse of the Soviet Union – a period of radical change where no one (including the authorities) had a firm grasp of what was happening or what would happen next. In such situations, participants’ thinking is “time-bound” rather than timeless – rational expectations theories that assume a kind of timeless equilibrium simply do not account for this real-world uncertainty.I was aware of the uncertainty associated with reflexivity, but even I was taken by surprise by how extreme the uncertainty became in 2008. It cost me dearly. I got the general direction of the markets right, but I did not allow for the volatility along the way. As a consequence, I took positions that were too big to withstand those swings, and several times I was forced to reduce positions at the worst possible time (during a spike in volatility) in order to limit my risk. I would have done much better if I had taken smaller positions and stuck with them through the turmoil. I learned the hard way that the range of uncertainty is itself uncertain – at times it can become practically infinite.Uncertainty finds expression in volatility. Increased volatility forces a reduction in risk exposure, as investors and banks pull back – this leads to what Keynes called “liquidity preference,” a preference for holding cash or easily sellable assets when uncertainty is high. This dynamic contributes to the forced liquidation of positions that characterizes financial crises. When a crisis eventually abates (calms down) and the range of uncertainty is reduced, it leads to an almost automatic rebound in the stock market. Why? Because people’s liquidity preference stops increasing and eventually declines – in other words, when fear recedes, money that fled to safe assets starts coming back into the market. (This is another lesson I learned recently: the sharper the spike in uncertainty and liquidity preference during a crash, the stronger the technical rebound can be when confidence slowly returns.)I should point out that my near-vs-far equilibrium dichotomy was a conceptual tool I introduced to make sense of a confusing reality; it doesn’t perfectly reflect reality, because reality is always more complex than the neat categories we impose. Still, the recent crisis truly was comparable to a “hundred-year storm.” We had a number of smaller crises leading up to it – those were like five- or ten-year storms. Regulators who had successfully dealt with the smaller squalls were less successful when they tried to apply the same methods to a once-in-a-century meltdown.Here, let me take a pause and share Ray Dalio’s beautiful presentation of economic cycles: SubscribeThese general remarks prepare the ground for a specific hypothesis I have put forward to explain the recent financial crisis. It’s not derived by deductive logic from my bubble theory, but it is consistent with it. So here it goes: I contend that the puncturing of the U.S. subprime housing bubble in 2007 set off the explosion of a “super-bubble,” much as an ordinary bomb sets off a nuclear explosion. The housing bubble in the United States was the most common kind of boom–bust (distinguished only by the widespread use of new collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other synthetic instruments during the boom). Behind this ordinary housing bubble, however, there was a much larger super-bubble that had been growing over a longer period – and it was much more peculiar.The prevailing trend in this super-bubble was the ever-increasing use of credit and leverage throughout the system. The prevailing misconception behind the super-bubble was the belief that financial markets are self-correcting and should be left to their own devices. President Reagan called this belief “the magic of the marketplace,” and I call it market fundamentalism – the idea that markets will tend toward equilibrium and correct any excesses on their own, without the need for government intervention. This belief became the dominant economic creed in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States and Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.What made the super-bubble so peculiar is that financial crises themselves helped it grow. Since the belief was that markets could be safely left alone, the build-up of the super-bubble led to a series of financial crises. The first and most serious was the international banking crisis of 1982 (the Latin American debt crisis). This was followed by many other crises: notably the portfolio insurance debacle in October 1987 (when a new hedging strategy backfired and contributed to the Black Monday stock crash), the Savings & Loan crisis that unfolded in episodes from 1989 to 1994 (thousands of small banks failed in the U.S.), the emerging markets crisis of 1997–1998 (Asian financial crisis and Russian default), and the bursting of the Internet stock bubble in 2000. Each time one of these crises occurred, the authorities stepped in: they intervened, arranged rescues or mergers for failing institutions, provided monetary and fiscal stimulus (interest rate cuts, liquidity infusions, government spending) to protect the overall economy. These measures worked – the economy and markets stabilized – and in doing so, they reinforced the prevailing trend (more credit, more leverage, ever-growing financial flows). But as long as the interventions succeeded, they also reinforced the prevailing misconception: the belief that markets left to themselves were coping just fine.It was a misconception because, in reality, it was the authorities’ intervention each time that saved the system. Nevertheless, these crises seemed like successful tests of the market’s resilience – and thus they validated the false belief. Each crisis averted without abandoning market fundamentalism inflated the super-bubble further.Eventually, the credit expansion behind the super-bubble became unsustainable. In 2007, the subprime mortgage market in the U.S. collapsed – and that collapse set off a chain reaction. One market after another fell, in quick succession, because they were all interconnected (the firewalls had been removed by deregulation). This is what distinguishes the 2007–2009 financial crisis from all those that preceded it: earlier crises were isolated events or contained by regulations, whereas this time the system’s defenses were down and contagion spread rapidly. The subprime crisis of 2007 constituted the turning point – the beginning of the end for the super-bubble. The collapse then reached its climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, which precipitated a large-scale financial panic and a global credit freeze. That forced the authorities into the most extensive intervention ever seen.(It is characteristic of my boom–bust model that one cannot predict in advance whether a test will be contained or will spiral out of control. This holds for ordinary bubbles as well as the super-bubble. For instance, I personally thought the emerging market crisis of 1997–98 might be the tipping point to burst the super-bubble – but I was wrong. The authorities managed to save the system then, and the super-bubble kept growing. That made the eventual bust in 2008 all the more devastating when it finally came.)After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the financial markets had to be put on artificial life support by governments and central banks. This was a shock not only for the financial sector but also for the real economy – global trade and output plummeted in late 2008. However, the emergency measures did work: financial markets stabilized and the economy gradually revived in 2009. A year after Lehman, the whole episode feels like a bad dream, and many people would like to forget it. There is a widespread desire to treat the 2007–2009 crisis as just another bump in the road and return to business as usual. But reality is unlikely to oblige – the system is actually broken and needs to be fixed.RETHINKING REGULATORYMy analysis offers some worthwhile clues to the kind of regulatory reform that’s needed.1) since markets are bubble-prone, the financial authorities have to accept responsibility for preventing bubbles from growing too big. Alan Greenspan and others have expressly refused to accept that responsibility. If markets can’t recognize bubbles, Greenspan asserted, neither can regulators—and he was right. Nevertheless, the financial authorities have to accept the assignment, knowing full well that they will not be able to meet it without making mistakes. They will, however, have the benefit of receiving feedback from the markets, which will tell them whether they have done too much or too little. They can then correct their mistakes.2) in order to control asset bubbles, it’s not enough to control the money supply; you must also control the availability of credit. This can’t be done by using only monetary tools; you must also use credit controls. The best-known tools are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements. Currently they are fixed irrespective of the market mood, because markets are not supposed to have moods—yet they do. The financial authorities need to vary margin and minimum capital requirements in order to control asset bubbles. Regulators may also have to invent new tools or revive ones that have fallen into disuse. For instance, in my early days in finance many years ago, central banks used to instruct commercial banks to limit their lending to a particular sector of the economy—such as real estate or consumer loans—because they felt that the sector was overheating. Market fundamentalists consider that crass interference with the market mechanism, but they are wrong.Central banks used to do it; we had no financial crisis to speak of. The Chinese authorities do it today, and they have much better control over the banking system than we do. The deposits that commercial banks have to maintain at the central bank were increased 17 times in China during the boom, and when the authorities later reversed course to stimulate growth, the banks quickly obeyed and expanded credit as instructed.Consider the Internet stock bubble: Alan Greenspan identified the tech stock frenzy early (his “irrational exuberance” speech in 1996 shows that). But aside from making that speech, he did nothing to avert the bubble. He felt that reducing the money supply would have been too blunt an instrument to use and could hurt the wider economy – and he was right about that. But he had other tools at his disposal: like, he could have asked the SEC to temporarily freeze new stock offerings. Why? Because the internet boom was fueled by equity leveraging – companies were rushing to issue new shares at high prices and use that capital to fund even more expansion, feeding the frenzy. Limiting new share issuance for a time could have cooled the bubble. Greenspan didn’t do that, because it would have violated his market fundamentalist beliefs (that the government should not interfere with free markets). In hindsight, it’s clear that a more interventionist approach might have mitigated the damage of the 2000 crash.3) Since markets are inherently unstable, there are systemic risks (risks to the entire system) that go beyond the risks to individual market participants. In good times, participants often ignore systemic risk, believing they can always sell to someone else before a crash (“I’ll be out before the music stops”). But regulators cannot ignore systemic risk – if too many people are on the same side of a bet, everyone can’t get out at once without causing a market collapse. Authorities must monitor the overall positions of major market participants in order to detect dangerous imbalances. This means the positions of all major actors – including hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds – should be monitored (at least in aggregate). Certain financial derivatives, like credit default swaps (CDS) – insurance-like contracts that pay off if a borrower defaults – and exotic options (like knock-out options, which expire worthless if a certain extreme event happens) are particularly prone to creating hidden leverage and interconnections. Therefore, such instruments must be regulated and, if needed, restricted or even outlawed if they pose a systemic threat. Additionally, creating complex synthetic securities (like structured debt obligations) should require regulatory approval (just as issuing stocks or bonds does), so that regulators can vet new products for systemic risk before they spread.4) We must recognize that financial markets evolve in a one-directional, non-reversible manner. In the recent crisis, in order to save the system, authorities effectively extended an implicit guarantee to every institution deemed “too big to fail.” Now that this has happened, they cannot simply withdraw that guarantee – doing so would undermine confidence. As long as giant institutions exist whose failure would endanger the system, the government is on the hook for them. Therefore, regulators must impose rules to ensure that this implicit guarantee never has to be used. “Too big to fail” banks must be required to use less leverage and accept strict limits on how they invest depositor’s money. For example, deposits (insured by the government) should not be used to finance risky proprietary trading. Regulators need to go further and align incentives properly: they should regulate the compensation packages of traders at big banks so that risks and rewards are better balanced (to discourage excessive risk-taking for short-term bonus gains). Such measures may push a lot of speculative proprietary trading (trading for the bank’s own profit) out of the banks and into hedge funds – which is actually where those activities belong, since hedge funds can be allowed to fail without requiring taxpayer bailouts.Just as oil tankers are compartmentalized to prevent a single breach from capsizing the ship, the financial system needs firewalls between markets. It may not be practical to completely separate investment banking from commercial banking again (as the U.S. Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 once did), but large financial firms should at least be internally compartmentalized so that risky trading bets cannot bring down essential banking functions. We should also consider breaking up huge financial conglomerates that have become quasi-monopolies or that are simply too complex and big to manage safely.Finally, international banking regulations (the Basel Accords) made a mistake in how they assessed risk. They gave certain securities (like highly rated mortgage bonds, CDOs, etc.) much lower risk weightings than ordinary loans, encouraging banks to hold lots of these securities. Regulators ignored the fact that a concentrated position in supposedly safe securities can be just as risky as regular loans – especially since in a crisis, those securities can all crash in value at the same time (a systemic risk). This flawed rule was an important factor that aggravated the crisis. It needs to be corrected by raising the risk ratings for securities held by banks, forcing banks to hold more capital against them. That will make securitized assets less artificially attractive and probably discourage the excessive securitization of loans going forward.In summary, all these measures will likely reduce the profitability and leverage of banks on average – which is a necessary adjustment for stability. This raises an interesting question of timing. We are not in a position to implement all these permanent reforms immediately without consequences. Right now (late 2009), the financial system and the economy are very far from equilibrium – still fragile after the crisis. You cannot bring a system back to near-equilibrium conditions with one straightforward corrective move. Just as when a car is skidding on ice you must first turn the wheel into the skid to regain control before you can steer normally, in this crisis the short-term actions needed were exactly the opposite of the long-term fixes. In the immediate aftermath of the crash, the credit that evaporated from the private sector had to be replaced by the only credible remaining source: the state. That meant governments had to increase national debt and central banks had to vastly expand the monetary base (create money) to stop the collapse (the equivalent of turning into the skid). As the economy stabilizes, however, the authorities must then “turn the wheel back” – shrink the monetary base as fast as private credit revives, otherwise deflation will flip into inflation.We are still in the first phase of this delicate maneuver. Banks are in the process of earning their way out of deep losses (recapitalizing themselves through profits). To prematurely reduce their profitability now – by enforcing strict new capital or lending rules too soon – would be counterproductive and could choke off recovery. Thus, major regulatory reforms have to wait until the second phase, when the economy is on more solid footing and the money supply (credit conditions) can be tightened without causing a relapse. The reforms then need to be carefully phased in so as not to disrupt the recovery. But we absolutely cannot afford to forget about implementing these changes when the time comes.CONCLUSIONYou have seen that my interpretation of financial markets – call it the theory of reflexivity – is very different from the efficient market hypothesis. Strictly speaking, neither theory is easily falsifiable in the Popperian sense (each can adapt to explain events post hoc). I myself predicted the eventual bursting of this super-bubble back in 1998; I was wrong on the timing then. Am I right now? We’ll see. And indeed some proponents of the efficient market hypothesis are still clinging to it even in the face of the entire collapse we just witnessed.Still, there is a widespread feeling that we need a new paradigm in economics and finance, and I contend that my theory provides a better explanation of boom–bust phenomena than the available alternatives. Behavioral economics, which has been gaining recognition (especially after the crisis), deals with only one half of reflexivity – the misinterpretations and cognitive biases that cause individuals to deviate from rationality. But it does not yet study the feedback loops by which those mispricings and misconceptions can actually change the fundamentals. In other words, behavioral finance focuses on investor psychology, but not so much on how markets can move reality, which is the reflexivity insight.I realize that my theory of financial markets is still very rudimentary and needs a lot more development. Obviously I cannot develop it all on my own. So perhaps I was premature in proposing my theory as the new paradigm. But one thing is certain: the efficient market hypothesis has proven inadequate. In fact, it has been conclusively disproved by recent events. The entire edifice of global financial markets, which has been erected on the false premise that markets can be left to their own devices, has to be rebuilt from the ground up on a sounder conceptual footing.~ George Soros, 2009MY SUMMARY, Key pointsSo, reflexivity describes a two-way feedback loop between market perceptions and the underlying reality. Soros argues that investors’ biased views don’t just reflect the world – they change it. Very important. This means that market prices can distort fundamentals and, in turn, altered fundamentals can further influence prices. The result is a dynamic, non-equilibrium process driving market booms and busts.So, rather than accurately reflecting all available information (as EMH claims), prices often give a biased view of reality. Investors never have perfect information or understanding – their views are fallible. Soros calls this the principle of fallibility: in situations involving thinking participants, each participant’s view of the world is inherently partial and distorted. For example, exuberant investor sentiment can bid up a stock far beyond what objective earnings would justify. The market price, in such cases, is not a neutral mirror of fundamentals but a funhouse mirror that exaggerates or diminishes aspects of reality.Because investor perceptions are distorted, the actions based on those perceptions can alter the fundamentals they aim to observe. For instance, if investors collectively believe a company is promising and bid up its stock, that company can raise capital cheaply and make the belief true by expanding its business – the initial mispricing changes the fundamental reality.These two principles directly contradict the EMH, because they conclude that participants constantly misinterpret reality and then unintentionally create a new reality by acting on those misperceptions. In such a world, certainty is impossible and predictions can fail because any belief can influence the outcome it predicts, blurring cause and effect.A negative feedback loop is one where any divergence between market price and fundamentals generates pressures to restore balance. In a negative feedback situation, when prices overshoot, forces are triggered that pull them back toward equilibrium (and if prices undershoot, forces push them up). Thus, negative feedback tends toward stability. In a positive feedback loop, a change in price drives changes in fundamentals or investor behavior that further fuel the price move in the same direction. Instead of converging to equilibrium, positive feedback loops lead to disequilibrium: prices and underlying reality move farther and farther apart. A positive feedback process often starts small and feeds on itself: rising prices improve fundamentals, which justify even higher prices, and so on. However, it cannot run indefinitely – eventually the gap between perception and reality becomes unsustainably wide. At that point a reversal or breaking point is reached, and the feedback may even flip to self-reinforce in the opposite direction (a crash). Like Amazon back during the dotcom era, and Tesla during these times… (and other AI names)…Every bubble starts with a real-world trend, paired with a mistaken belief (misconception) that relates to that trend. The trend is something actually happening (e.g. a technological innovation, a policy change, or easy credit conditions), and the misconception is an exaggerated or false narrative about what that trend means. When these two reinforce each other, a positive feedback loop is triggered and a boom begins. As the bubble develops, rising prices validate the misconception for a time. Both the trend and the false narrative strengthen: success breeds more confidence, attracting more capital that further boosts the market. Soros notes that along the way, the bubble is “liable to be tested by negative feedback” – for instance, a minor price correction or external shock might occur. If the prevailing trend and narrative survive these tests (i.e. if the dip only momentarily shakes confidence and then prices surge to new highs), that resilience actually reinforces the belief in the trend. Surviving a scare convinces participants that “nothing can derail this market,” which brings in even more money. This is why bubbles often accelerate: each pullback that doesn’t break the trend ends up amplifying the subsequent rally, as skeptics capitulate and join in. During this phase, feedback is overwhelmingly positive and self-reinforcing.Eventually, the disconnect between market perception and reality grows too great to ignore. Prices may begin to stall despite continued optimism. This is called a twilight period by Soros when “doubts grow and more people lose faith” even as the trend plateau continues out of sheer inertia. Essentially, cracks in the narrative appear – savvy investors start taking profits or insiders hint at issues – but many participants keep playing the game hoping the music hasn’t stopped. In this stage, the positive feedback has waned; the trend flattens out and complacency mixes with anxiety. Sooner or later, a trigger or tipping point is reached – it could be a policy change, a string of bad earnings reports, tightening credit, or simply a critical mass of investors wanting out. The prevailing trend reverses, and the feedback loop flips direction. Now sell-offs beget more sell-offs: as prices fall, leveraged investors face margin calls and are forced to liquidate, which drives prices down further in a cascading effect. What was once self-reinforcing on the way up becomes self-reinforcing on the way down. The final stage often features capitulation and a financial crisis, as the most leveraged or optimistic players are wiped out. Only after the crash can the market find a new equilibrium (often at a level much closer to fundamental reality, or even below it due to over-correction). From a speculator’s perspectivean inflating bubble is not a signal to immediately bet against it (short it). Instead, it can be a great opportunity to ride the wave with a long position – so long as one remains vigilant for the turn. Profit-seeking investors will often rationally participate in a bubble’s expansion, because the early and middle phases of a boom can be immensely profitable. Exiting too early means leaving money on the table, and shorting too early can be fatal (as the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent). When one is net long, time is on his side, when one is net short, time is against him. Great speculators are always waiting patiently for the trend confirmations.This lecture fundamentally shaped my market perspective. It was around that time that I started investing and began experimenting with mathematical models of market moves. Most of my momentum models are built on an extension of this theory and on its implications for market microstructure—models you’ve also seen over the past years functioning with a very high accuracy rate.The most important thing is to be able to identify the liquidity structures that form within a cycle, because those are the market’s responses to the prevailing narratives and events. And in whether a structure strengthens or breaks, the narrative—and the market sentiment attached to it—is reflected. This is what many people intuitively “feel,” but don’t necessarily understand consciously. This is what I call the context of the liquidity structure. If we understand the context, and we understand how liquidity structures—and the RoC of supply/demand ratios—respond to the unfolding of macro events, then the market starts “speaking to us”, and we can gain a meaningful edge. (And that is why I so often emphasize: don’t fall for the strange misconception that dealer flows drive the markets. Options positioning is forward‑looking, because it is the manifestation of bets on the future—on spot, on time, and on volatility. That is why its real significance lies in the structural context: within that context it projects probabilities that provide substantial help in building trading and risk‑management strategies across different time horizons.) That is why it’s so important to devote as much time as possible to understanding the context and the market’s responses to it. This requires time and composure—precisely what this artificially accelerated, fake world does not support. But you should resist it anyway. Stop, and give your mind time to catch up with events—to let them truly sink in. Educational postsLiquidity structure | Let's put speed profile into contextAlma·Jan 7During the 2021 GameStop gamma squeeze, the retail crowd discovered the options market and the hedging activity of market makers. The newly discovered “low – the idea that options positioning can directly impact the price of the underlying asset – went through multiple, almost conspiratorial misinterpretations. On the back of this, a lot of furus jumped into building gamma/delta etc. data-providing services, operating on the old “sell shovels during a gold rush” principle.Read full storyAnother extra addendum…Back then, during the 2008/09 crisis, many people believed capitalism had ultimately fallen. Even then, I thought the Western economy still had plenty of tools to get through the weaknesses in capitalism’s ideologies, and new narratives and ‘fuels’ were still about to come (internet, AI, increased retail derivative trading activity, etc.)—precisely because of Soros’s principle of reflexivity.However, the situation has already changed: geopolitical realignments—because history did not stop—alongside overpopulation, and the fact that our activity is proveably having a long-term harmful impact both on the psyche and on the living world, in ways that after a certain point will no longer be reversible. Yet too many actors have too many chips in the game. All of it needs to be flushed out.To loosen geopolitical constraints and reduce countries’ dependence on big capital, they want to shift toward national economic models (see US’ new NSS, I predicted this too) that is fundamentally incompatible with the core principles of capitalism. And to halt market competition that accelerates toward the infinite—in order to place greater weight on quality and to protect the living world—they want to introduce third‑way economic systems, because this cannot be realised in a capitalist world. Capitalism is on its last legs. I’ll be talking about this in a podcast soon.But the key point is this: capitalism will not collapse because of the crisis; the crisis will come because of the deliberate toppling of capitalism—when the Americans, the Middle Easterners, and the Russians jointly crash the markets and reallocate them onto the blockchain, as I described last year.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.
