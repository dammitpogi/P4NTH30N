Market analysis[free] SPX, Gold, BTC - A quick overview of the recent momentum and sentimentNov 18, 202522ShareHere I explained my window of risk call that I updated as policy is erratic nowadays, while sentiment is overoptimistic and not pricing in any bad news. Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Alma·October 29, 2025Read full storyNow I want to quick review how it is going now for the SPX, gold and Bitcoin… SubscribeI won’t cover my precise quantitative outputs here (in terms of levels, dynamics and sentiment) like I do behind the paywall, but I do cover the overall momentums as they currently look…SPX As long as the market cannot build structure above the “upside pivot” marked area, the tendency remains risky and cautious. I personally does not expect it to happen in the near term as you know, market has seriously shaken. Earler I warned my followers on Twitter saying that going against seasonality is a big source of liquidity.SPX is currently testing the November lows that is a significant pivot sentiment wise, and both the weekly and intraday positioning derived pivots are coincidencing with this zone. Very important to watch it through the week. The downside target is the marked quite wide range. Last weekly and this current weekly positioning both points into that range. A 10% decline below 6200 would be healthy but I see low chance to happen due to the current motivations behind policy to cover any weaknesses. I think, more volatility is coming after VIX expo. Providing a potential buy-the-dip opportunity for an EOY rebound on a december hawkish Fed cut.But I will be careful with any of this. Simply because my warning earlier.Gold As long as Gold is building structure below the upside area marked with a yellow line, the odds are shifting towards a temporal retest of the lows as people are locking profit from gold. It can happen two ways: in time or in terms of spot.The first one is more likely as it looks now especially as dollar/gold correlation is also on a pivotal tendency again… I suspect an uptrend in their beta similar to 2021-2022, simply due to stagflation, central bank demand and geo concerns. If the dollar is ripping because the world is blowing up (policy accident, geopolitics, hard-landing panic) and real yields drop on rate-cut expectations, then you can absolutely get USD up and gold up together. If the admin is more concerned about yields, while stagflation materializes, we can see stronger dollar, capping gold (not necessary pressing it lower). I suspect stronger dollar and rangebounding gold in the near-term as the most likely scenario. Second likeliest scenario is a gold retesting the marked upside then going below the pivot, while dollar starts to strenghten, then gold reverses back up. This would be a more natural trend, also would cause the beta to retest down a bit making higher low before going more up.Anyway, I expect gold reaching 5k in the next year. BTC In July I posted this chart of Bitcoin: saying: “It is trading at ~119,940.88 currently. Here are the levels I’m watching:122,056.68 is our major local resistance, but the true “line in the sand” is 107,500.61 - this levels will prove us if BTC spot wants a melt up towards 143,519.88 before taking its gains back, or if it has already topped.My main target zone where I’m interested to buy into BTC is 56,183.44 - 67,250.15Participants expect weakness starting to be realized during August, and expect volatility after October.” Well, BTC failed to build a structure above 122k, and indeed broke 107k after October just as expected. This call is still intact, I don’t see any reason to change it. I don’t play speculating game on cryptos, I only make really long-term trades with them. For now, the two consecutive red weekly candles below the pivot of 107k look prove the downtrend. I think, we wil see a bounce back toward 107k and also 112-115k area, to retest the liquidity. That will be the actual pivotal pattern. (Similar for Ethereum with 3700/6900, 3200 and 2880/3000 areas)All-in-allFor now, market has shaken, and trust in this economy and admin became really fragile for multiple reasons: erratic policy, insufficient foregn policy with big leaders, USA inner conflicts (like SCOTUS), stagflation, shutdown, missing autumn datas, too much mechanical flows-driven aggressive market trends, blindfolded Fed, corruption, shifting world-order, AI bubble (with growing technical and supply-chain concerns, and heavily concentrated market), and looming debt crisis that the leaders are not seem to be willing to handle properly. Big money is scaling out. Current market is for momentum traders, not for investors. This is crucial. A lot of processes have started to happen that look irreversible and market is not prepared as it has been complacent and numb on the admin’s promises lately. Now, it will start to reprice the risk over the next several months.
