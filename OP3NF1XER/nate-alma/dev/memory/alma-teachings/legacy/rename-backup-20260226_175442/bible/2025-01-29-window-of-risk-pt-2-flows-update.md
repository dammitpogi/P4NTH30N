Market analysisWindow of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Oct 29, 20253042ShareWhat on earth is going on in these markets?There are no gap fills, valuation metrics are on the moon, the put/call ratio is in China—along with market breadth—while the SPX/VIX/VVIX correlation is trending higher. Every dip is being bought, levered up via the options market; short-vol and short-vomma trades are aggressively crowded, and lately they’ve even been attacking realised volatility and realised vol-of-vol too.The reasons should be sought in the globally shifting geopolitical landscape—much like when political parties campaign for power: burnishing their achievements by falsifying and wrenching them out of context to look better to their supporters. I wrote at length about this earlier, in April. Please (re)read it. Pro tip: don’t believe that China will ever give up. Eastern people are patient and tactical, unlike Trump…Window of RiskMy earlier “Window of Risk” (WoR) calls this year were: February–April window — I flagged the April drop days in advance, with then-unbelievable downside targets that were hit.Correction in May — My primary WoR ran from the May ECB rate decision to mid-May (Trump’s visit to the Middle East). We saw a ~97-point decline in SPX, but the market did not break my target level from which momentum could have flipped into left-tail risk.(Later, a 124-point decline materialized after Trump’s visit, but that wasn’t the risk I expected; it followed directly from weekly positioning with an exact target. The same applies to the 107-point decline in the 16–20 June week.)July/August window — Essentially my original major WoR: the post-NFP and FOMC period, once tariff effects began to show up in the data. I marked it into mid-August. The effects did start to appear, and we got a 215-point decline—still not a break of the level that would have triggered the left-tail risk I’d been flagging.(In mid-August another 138-point decline followed, but again the structure held. By mid-July it had also become clear to me that the market would remain supported, and I emphasised that my WoR was shifting towards the post-September OpEx period.)Post-September OpEx — I called for supportive flows into Monday and the WoR starting on Tuesday: that produced a 130.3-point pullback. I then called for volatility and vomma supply, and for the week of 6 October I flagged weakness and a potential vol spike into the Thu–Fri window, which delivered a 213.8-point pullback.The common feature of these shake-offs is that none of them broke the structure—neither in dynamics nor at key levels—and this was highly likely on the basis of weekly flow analysis, as I kept updating in intraday posts. Quantitatively speaking, even the quant funds did not hit any triggers. As I warned, risk kept being eroded via time correction—a superficial, paper-only erosion rather than a real one. SubscribeFlowsSPX/VIX/VVIX are green — though the last only slightly, relatively speaking. This says that whole curve is bid. Yet, there is still no volatility squeeze, because realised volatility and realised vol-of-vol remain managed intraday and via weekly zomma. What I mean is this: to the downside, realised volatility is being sold, as the downside convexity of the short-speed profile compresses intraday returns; to the upside, returns can widen because there is an upward vacuum. On an intraday basis, both realised and implied volatility are being sold via tail gamma and VIX. Zomma is also being supplied again. Meaning, we are at the right-end of the curve, where the gamma/IV relationship is positive, managing realised vol in the event of a gamma squeeze. Because being short gamma means to be short realized volatility.These are the force that is preventing any volatility squeeze for now. And this is crucial for the insiders because volatility would indicate crash now, something they cannot let to happen again. SubscribeRetail speculators have emerged as a major force (over 22% of total volume), consistently buying stocks even as institutions step back roughly 85% of the time. 0DTE flows made up about 62.4% of total SPX options volume. Meanwhile, large institutions are keeping their core holdings (so as not to lag the indices) but have added hedges and simultaneously reduced positions in roughly 90% of the weeks since August. They are sceptical of this rally; their sentiment is heavily negative, they see greater risk in holding longs, and they are scaling out into strength — but only gradually, so as not to bombard the market with sell orders or risk underperformance. They want to reload once the market is trading for discount again.The supply is being absorbed by dealers’ intraday and weekly longer realised- and implied-volatility positions on the downside, and by retail flow. And this is crucial, because it means the momentum we are experiencing is not fully organic. The constant, shady misses of gap fills are a tell. In other words, this rally is not the result of large long-term institutions pouring in; it is largely mechanical, driven by dealers and fast-money traders leveraging options. The exact mechanisms of these dynamics are described in-depth in this (free) September post: Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tellsAlma·September 18, 2025Read full storyOctober rate decision FOMCSPX/yields correlation is positive ahead of the FOMC, though it has eased over the past few sessions. That may suggest Bessent is not expecting an especially dovish aftermath, but only short-lived, we will see.  A rate cut is widely viewed as a done deal and largely priced in, which is why forward guidance matters much more at this point. If the Fed does not exceed dovish expectations, there is a risk—indeed, a short-term opportunity—of a “sell-the-news” dip. Markets also expect the Fed to announce an end to quantitative tightening. I do not expect any crash to happen in the mid term. However, I still expect my 6–10% correction to play out soon. Statistically, when the Fed cut rates when the market was within 1–3% of an all-time high, the market was up by 14.95% on average within the next 12 months, in an average of 96.5% of cases (including 2019 and 2024). November–December window is historically the strongest months for actual buyback executions and volatility selling.However, keep in mind that going against seasonality can be a major source of liquidity for the insiders if they want to reload—not fully going against it, but enough to create a brief scare before the end-of-year rally. Corporate demand is set to return robustly in November, adding a steady bid for stocks. ShutdownThe shutdown was not accounted for when I wrote my ‘Window of Risk’ post in September. I marked the end of that window at the end of the buyback blackout. That is right, but—as I keep emphasising—on the longer tenor there is a synthetic, hidden long vomma in the market due to geopolitical risk, which makes the market headline-sensitive. So the ‘Window of Risk’ will end when shutdown ends and we start to receive the data again.Active data collection is halted under the Labor Department’s contingency plan. The September CPI was compiled and released late (24 October) because much of that month’s pricing had already been gathered; October CPI collection has been disrupted, and the White House and media are signalling no October CPI release next month. This means survey interviewing, price collection, data processing and most publications stop. We can therefore expect heavier revisions later and, in some cases, skipped months, and the data may become more controlled. When the funding bill is signed (a continuing resolution or full-year appropriations), the shutdown ends. No date yet.Target and strategyAs you may know, I’m net bullish for the next 4-5 years. I already covered this.My recent target for this window is shown here: As you can see on the chart, I estimate the maximum target for a potential melt-up at 7,146.88 for SPX and a downside target at the August-peak/October-bottom liquidity zone.This is a primary target, because the book has been very thin since the summer. Given this thin positioning data, it is hard to estimate exact potential scenarios.However, I don’t expect any crash—only a pullback, a local left-tail event where we can take yearly risk-on bets. Until structure breaks and pullback is confirmed I use flies, ratios and calendar spreads as a hedge to catch front-end volatility.
