Market analysisThe risk is in the bond market! + Intraday post (23/May) Further addition to yesterday's postMay 23, 2025∙ Paid2313Share“Roses are blue,Violets are red,The economy is stable,and this is a bull market…”~AHere you can find my weekly post, and here is yesterday post. Please, re-read its section about the bond market, as it is crucial to understand for the coming weeks. Let me show you these two charts:andSwap spread is the fixed rate you receive in an interest‑rate swap minus the yield on the corresponding Treasury (e.g. 30‑year swap rate minus 30‑year UST). When spreads turn negative, it means swap dealers are willing to pay fixed at a rate below what the U.S. government offers—because they desperately want to receive floating SOFR or obtain Treasury collateral.Last print for 30y is –93 bp, well below its long‑run average around –80 bp, and near its worst (–97 bp on April 8). Short tenors (2Y at –24 bp) are “only” modestly negative; the long end (20Y, 30Y) is far more inverted. This tells that stress is concentrated in longer‑dated funding. (see my ‘hidden QE’ call) This signals signals severe funding and liquidity stress: banks would rather pay to receive floating (SOFR) than hold Treasuries, reflecting concerns over collateral scarcity, repo market strains and heightened credit risk.Historically, extreme negative swap spreads have preceded bond‑market meltdowns (2008, 2020…), foreshadowed equity drawdowns, as funding strains propagate to risk‑assets via leveraged hedge funds and delta‑hedged positions and force central banks to adjust regulatory ratios (e.g., SLR waivers) or deploy liquidity backstops (standing repo, QE) to restore market functioning.It is the weighing machine, not the voting one.SubscribeThe key is again the timing… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
