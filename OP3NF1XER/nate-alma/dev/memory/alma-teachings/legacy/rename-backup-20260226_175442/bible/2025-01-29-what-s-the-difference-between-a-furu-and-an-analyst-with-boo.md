What’s the Difference Between a “Furu” and an Analyst? (with book recommendations)Let me explain... (free post, off-topic)May 03, 20255822ShareThis is an important topic, because fraud has always followed in history’s footsteps—scams that preyed on the uninformed or impulsive, leaving them financially ruined. With the spread of the telephone, TV, and then the internet, these schemes have grown even more brazen. Although the law tries to regulate them, it can’t truly protect victims—ultimately each person decides whether to hand over their money, especially if they haven’t done their due diligence to check whether the promisor’s claim is legit.The essence of liberal capitalism is that the consumer becomes a product, complete with all their personal data and ignorance. Companies, banks, brokers, and businesses trample over one another in fierce competition to get you to spend your hard-earned money with them. This is especially true in the West, where consumer-protection regulations are disastrously lax. And there’s exactly one reason and one goal behind it all: GDP.Laypeople tend to gravitate toward stock-market “gurus” (furus) because their statements are straightforward. Even if they’re not always right, “at least they say something.” In contrast, an analyst, in the eyes of a novice, is someone who rambles about complex charts and dynamics without making a clear, straight-ahead market-direction prediction. So the average person picks the guru, simply because someone at least tells them what to do. They don’t have to think—just copy-trade, and if they lose, they can blame it on the guru (though there are no real consequences). You don’t get that with an analyst.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

They pay for analyses and even steal… I mean borrow information from other gurus, since competition in this “industry” is fierce. Their hit rates therefore vary.But their content tends to be overly straightforward. Why? Because furus are in a guessing race with each other. A furu must demonstrate a certain hit rate to appear credible to subscribers—so they can’t make ambiguous, polysemous statements. And if they’re wrong, the subscriber’s risk management techniques are blamed (though teaching risk management is something furus rarely do). Furus lie about their win–loss stats, claiming special knowledge that makes them able to predict every future market moves. They promise this secret knowledge with massive overnight profits and laugh at Warren Buffett.The key attribute…Okay, this is all very common among anyone who are actively marketing themselves. But the key attribute is the lie that sets furus apart from analysts is the claim that market movements are always precisely predictable. They say this because, if market moves were always predictable, their “signal service” would be justified—and if a prediction hits, they can take full credit. That, however, is simply wrong.ANALYSTSA responsible analyst doesn’t think that way. You all know already that probability measures the area of specific event-sets within the universe of possible outcomes. There are times when certain market moves have an estimated probability above 80–90%. But a responsible analyst always thinks in terms of a probability distribution. That means examining the driving engine behind current market dynamics, then mapping out possible scenarios and their conditions (events, timing, price levels, and their implications). From this you get scenarios A, B, C, and D, each with assigned probabilities. Once you understand the market-dynamic engine, the conditions for A, B, C, and D can be well-defined. A subscribing customer can then apply the analyst’s framework to shape their own portfolio, trading style, and strategy. A responsible analyst must remain unbiased about market direction, since only one move has a 99.99…% probability—namely, that price will move from left to right. Even that isn’t 100%, since global catastrophes have non-zero probability. After mapping the dynamics and defining scenarios and their conditions, the analyst could design a portfolio strategy—but that falls under personalized financial or investment advice, which is a legal category unto itself. I’ll note that even a guru’s “signal service” borders on that line and often falls into illegality.So, unlike gurus who pander to lazy mindsets, an analyst’s article is merely a foundation. The trader uses their own knowledge to build their trading, investing, and risk-management strategies. From that point on, it’s their responsibility. This is crucial to understand this distinction.Unnecessary disclaimer…As I clarified at the start, my Substack service is focused on providing analysis only. It does not include signal services or personalized (or even general) financial or investment advice. Its primary goal is to satisfy the year-long demand for insight into how I think about markets— that I try to do through daily and weekly analyses, as well as themed educational posts.The key is learning to think in distributions. If you bet according to a well-estimated distribution of probabilities, your winning position will offset losses on the other side. Once you see the winning-condition scenario unfolding, you close your losing positions and increase your winners. This is how the pros do it. But it truly requires work.There’s a wealth of excellent educational material on the subject freely available online. Here are just a few to get you started (beside every free articles I attached to my educational posts):Richard D. Wyckoff - The Day Trader’s BibleBenjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor G. C. Selden - Psychology of the Stock MarketJ. J. Butler - Successful Stock Speculation Sheldon Natenberg - Option Volatility & Pricing Collin Bennett - Trading Volatility Nassim Taleb - Dynamics HedgingAnd also I highly recommend these following books for speculants: Cătălin Bărboianu - Probability Guide to GamblingAn exhaustive compendium of probability results for dice, roulette, slots, poker, and sports bets, with rigorous finite-sample probability foundations and combinatorial analysis. and - Understanding Your Game: A Mathematician's Advice for Rational and Safe GamblingEdward Packel - The Mathematics of Games and Gambling A mathematically sophisticated—but accessible—text covering game-theoretic models and probabilistic analysis for a broad array of gambling scenarios, including sports betting.Edward O. Thorp - The Mathematics of GamblingBy the pioneer of card-counting and quantitative trading; explains probability calculus in blackjack, baccarat, and introduces risk management principles through precise mathematical modelingDavid L. Dickinson - Gambling Habits and Probability Judgements in a Bayesian Task EnvironmentExamines how gamblers update beliefs using Bayes’ theorem, shedding light on cognitive biases in probability assessments. Siam Malhotra - Statistical Models and Predictive Algorithms in Sports Betting Bayesian Approaches, Machine Learning, and Monte Carlo SimulationsSurveys Bayesian methods, machine-learning techniques, and Monte Carlo simulations for modeling sports outcomes, emphasizing rigorous probabilistic frameworks. Walsh & Joshi - Machine Learning for Sports Betting: Should Model Selection Be Based on Accuracy or Calibration?Demonstrates that selecting predictive models on calibration (i.e., probabilities that match observed frequencies) rather than classification accuracy yields superior expected returns. Karl Whelan - Risk Aversion and Favourite–Longshot Bias in a Competitive Fixed-Odds Betting MarketEmpirical and theoretical analysis of why longshot bets underperform—and how risk preferences shape market odds—in online fixed-odds platforms.There is no royal road…This is just a small taste of the freely available studies and books you can learn from—not to mention the articles I’ve linked in my educational posts. As you can see, people’s problem isn’t a lack of sources but plain laziness. As Warren Buffett said, “The more you learn, the more you earn.”And my favorite comes from Dwayne Johnson: “People ask me what’s the key to success? The key is there is no key. Be humble, be hungry, and always be the hardest worker in the room.”Words to live by…Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.
