Failed paymentsFor free subscribers (info)Aug 20, 20252ShareDear Subscriber,I got a lot of emails about questions as you don’t see the contents below the paywalls, and failed payments.Sadly, despite the high fees, Stripe has such issues, but they have a very nice customer service, and they can help you with that (me personally, I can’t):Here you can reach them, 0-24 chat supportAnd also I recommend to write to the Substack support as well, that you can reach through this email: privacy@substackinc.comThey can solve the issue for you, and so you can come back.Educative posts are coming, and practical daily setups with accurate levels and timings with self-made indicators too. Also, I’m working on new ideas for the subscribers that you can use in TradingView.Also, I recommend to choose the monthly option, $35/month, as my time is limited here.
