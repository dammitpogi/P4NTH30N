Market analysisPivotal weeks ahead - Weekly post (1-5/Dec)Nov 30, 2025∙ Paid2321ShareLiterally at the bottom on Nov20, I was a cautious bull, and warned everybody to don’t be bearish there (even shared my call buyings). Said that I expeced consolidation into Monday and risk-taking come back on Tuesday.I marked the Oct27 gap as the main area that the SPX must re-conquer and build a structure in order to ease bearish pressure. The weekly positionings and intraday premarket analyses showed us, that the market is very confident about realized volatility decline in this area as they expect supportive liquidity to come in. (RV has slightly declined)… SubscribeI already shared charts, where I showed you that market didn’t really give us 6-10% declines after the quick and aggressive April rebound, as it usually gave during earlier occasions. Even if I take the overnight ranges into account, this recent decline was only a 5.98% pullback. A momentum-wise proportional amplitude should be more than a 6.49% pullback, that would wash out most of the risks, that should have been happen around 6697.78 (down to ~6248.55); however from the current highst, it should give a 7.27% decline from 6921.88 in order to wash out the risk (based on past-momentum analyses), roughly down to ~6418.65, that is fair close enough to the WoR downside target that I got from other quantitative analyses. Now, the question is, as always, what are the possibilities, and what is the pivot that will reveal it for us.I’ll speak Elliott-wave theory now in order to make it more clear. What is the difference between the two scenarios?Well, in the first scenario the recent pullback is not finished, this current rebound will not take out the highs, and we will get a very sharp last wave hit to the low of around 6418; the smaller structure’s C-wave align with the last one. However, in the second case, the case, the B-wave is a bulltrap, with an impulsive (hence more stable) 5-wave pattern, signaling a more sustained rally potentially up towards 7138, even to 7200; before the C-wave starts to materialize, a way bigger one, after late-Q1.Now, the key pivotal daily area is at 6760/70; that tells us which scenario the market gives us. Any pullback, retest that will occur now, should ultimately hold this area in order to prove us bullish continuation. Well, the headache is that volatility-wise it is the second scenario, but my momentum metrics are showing that there is more downside probability, like in scenario one.Fed is keyAs said, this shake-out is very serious, deep, investor-generated and fundamental. The question is if the repricing would be immediate or will be delayed in to Q2.For now, FOMC rate decision is key, as I said, Fed should bail out the sentiment. If they cut, it will be hawkish, but the question is, how hawkish they will be. How much risk do they place on the inflation vs growth. Logically, the bigger animal is growth and the ever-growing debt burden. That’s the real issue, and that’s what we have seen all over this rebound that the admin kept forcing the market up and up, even only on mechanical flows. As smart/”organic” money takes even smaller part of the daily and weekly flows, the impact of mechanical flows will grow. I already posted about it. Also the technical perspectives support this. So logically the odds still favor for the second scenario. For a sustained rally, the sentiment must be supportive.SubscribeNow, I will scrutinize the weekly positioning to see what levels the trader are watching, where are the dynamically important areas, and what the market is actually betting on… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
