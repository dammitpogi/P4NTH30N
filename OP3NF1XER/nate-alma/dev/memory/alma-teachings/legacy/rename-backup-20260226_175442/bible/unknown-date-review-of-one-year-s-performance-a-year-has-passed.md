Review of One Year's Performance | A year has passedReview of the first year of my substackFeb 03, 2026∙ Paid3183ShareA year has passed. I’d like to thank all of you for your support—both moral and financial—and for the trust you’ve placed in me.So let this post stand here as a reflection on the period behind us: I’ll review my own performance, share a few small updates, and announce an anniversary subscription discount.IntroductionIt’s been a year since I launched this Substack page, after a Twitter thread I posted in January 2024 about the dynamics of a vanna squeeze suddenly led to a surge of new followers. Over time, I increasingly felt that I wanted to share—on a daily basis—how I prepare for day trading ahead of the U.S. market open; back then, I often shared my trade signals as well.Even then, some people tried to discredit me in various ways in pursuit of their own business interests; others offered me work—or outright plagiarized my content. My analyses were bold and accurate (with the exception of the June–July 2024 gamma squeeze, when I was adapting on the fly). After only three months, hundreds of you asked me to create my own platform. When I didn’t, by the autumn of 2024 many of you were asking me to at least set up a “Buy Me a Coffee” page so you could show your appreciation for my work.In the end, my Substack launched in early February 2025, and in a single year it has grown to more than 2,500 subscribers—without any targeted marketing—despite shadow bans, divisive topics such as my geopolitical outlooks, and continued attempts to undermine my credibility.Among my subscribers you’ll find a wide range of people: from high-ranked senior fund managers and economists, to market makers, to individual retail speculators… a truly wonderful, diverse community.This year has challenged me in several ways, too. I had to learn how to tailor my thoughts and analyses as optimally as possible to the needs of roughly two thousand subscribers, and to communicate them clearly and in a structured way.That took time on my part—and patience on your part—since I’m inexperienced when it comes to services like this. But I think we’re on the right track.Thank you to those of you who believed in me.I’ve had private conversations with a number of them to ask what they find compelling about my work. Their feedback has been strikingly consistent, and it almost always boils down to three key points:1) I don’t compromise my integrity. During the April crash, a lot of traders arrived from other Discord servers looking for a “free lunch.” Even then, I stayed grounded in a probability-based framework and didn’t jump onto the popular finfluencer/guru bandwagon. I accepted the statistical consequences of that choice—and the reality that some of those people would leave disappointed and then spread lies about me.2) A stochastic, probabilistic mindset. Although my models can anticipate trends with high accuracy, I avoid absolute statements and I do not introduce bias that could—even subconsciously—impair readers’ judgement. Day after day, I explain and remind everyone of the market’s reality: in markets we bet on probability distributions, and we hedge probability distributions. I explicitly acknowledge that outcomes are conditional—and that an analyst’s job is to identify those conditions and the highest-probability scenarios implied by them, not to “predict” in a fortune-telling sense. The market is only highly predictable when the confidence level is genuinely high—and the underlying conditions are clearly defined.3) Breadth of analysis. I track both macro context and micro-level dynamics. I don’t overemphasize either; instead I adjust the weights of different determinants as their relevance changes. This is hard work—because, as one fund manager put it, I’m effectively doing the work of an entire research-desk team on my own.+1) Value for money. Some of you also emphasized that while the macro and micro data I work with are expensive—and processing them requires serious work and learning, not to mention building my individual models and evaluating the data (the product of a lifetime of study)—the subscription price remains significantly lower than what you would expect, especially given the accuracy. And that’s true: I initially shared everything for free, and today I charge a friendly price because this is not my full-time job—and because I want people with smaller savings to be able to be here as well. So I set what I consider a minimal, fair fee for the work.Changes and outlookAs I promised at launch—and repeatedly over the past year—I am increasing the subscription price. This does not affect existing subscriptions (just as the switch to euros didn’t). From now on, new subscribers can access the analyses for €52 per month. There will be no further increases.However, until the end of February, a 35% discount will be available, bringing the cost for the next year close to the previous price. You can access this offer via this link. I’ve also launched a referral program: you’ll receive a unique referral link, and new free subscribers who join through it will count as “referrals.” You should have received a separate automated email about this.Beyond that, more educational posts are coming—some in video format. I have a strong accent, so be prepared. I’m also planning short free podcasts on general market topics, geopolitics, and themes many of you have asked me to cover, such as the technical and philosophical perspectives of artificial intelligence.My models are under continuous development. I plan to recalibrate some models already in use and to build new ones (i.e., TradingView indicators for you). I have a lot of ideas.Originally, I planned to run this Substack for 1–1.5 years. At this point, I’m confident I can commit to the full 1.5 years. After August, we’ll see what happens. I don’t know how the next year will unfold, but with some of you I’ve agreed that—at worst—I will continue publishing the weekly posts and sharing the macro and educational content.And now, I’d like to examine—statistically—how my analyses have performed over the past year…Annual performance reviewI won’t share the exact code, because it is heavily AI‑based. And in any case it requires a special computer setup, and on top of that I didn’t write the neural network, claim graph, argument graph, assumption layer, etc. parts, because I don’t have the expertise for those… yet.Since a large part of the code is not my work, I can’t make the backtest method fully transparent; however, at the end of this letter I will attach, in a zip file, the downloaded posts, and you can test them yourselves as well. This file will of course only be available to paid subscribers.In the backtest I examined the accuracy rate. Because my analyses are mostly conditional, I looked at what percentage of the dynamics assigned to price levels and ranges actually materialized. I also included the volatility environment in this.In addition, I extracted and backtested my predictive statements about macro processes separately on the long‑term and short‑term timeframes. I examined, on the one hand, to what extent my forecasts were consistent with the available news and research‑desk publications, and on the other hand I also looked at how much time elapsed on average between my forecast and the forecasts on the same topic from the research desks available to me, and between the publicly documented start of the real processes and the forecasts. Then I calculated in what percentage of cases I was a front‑runner. Here, however, it is very important to keep in mind that quite a few forecasts have not yet materialized, so I also included those publicly available high‑quality reports that warn that the process is beginning.When analyzing the weekly analyses, two problems arose. First, the sample is very small, so statistically it is difficult to draw significant conclusions from them. Second, I only started describing the expected weekly dynamics in a systematic and consistent way a few months ago, but I did not have sufficiently high‑quality historical data to backtest these precisely. Therefore, for the weekly analyses the margin of error is very high, but the trend is well describable.I also did not include last year’s intraday trading signals in the backtest. Any subscriber can view these in the dedicated chat and backtest them.So the conclusion is that the edge of the intraday posts does not primarily come from the raw directional hit‑rate, but from the fact that around the specified levels the market behaves according to the functions assigned by me.Here are the results:Intraday posts:The average hit rate of the levels derived from the speed profile is 64.85%, which includes both the levels themselves and the realization of the dynamics assigned to them.With a 95% CI, even the lower bound of the data is above 55%, and 27.91% is greater than or equal to 75%.Performance is driven by the levels and the dynamics assigned to them.However, there is an approximately −0.099 correlation with volatility, which means that during higher volatility performance deteriorates slightly. In calm market environments there were several days when the forecast was 80–100% accurate, i.e., it practically indicated that day’s move perfectly. In contrast, on very hectic days—when market volatility was exceptionally high—the intraday hit rate dropped.Script inputs:As the inputs are not adjusted for skewness and kurtosis yet, we can expect that the general fat left-tail will distort the results towards underestimation.Expected 68.27% - realized 46.01%Expected 95.45% - realized 76.07%Expected 99.73% - realized 89.57%Expected 99.99% - realized 96.32%So the projected sigma most often underestimated the realized dispersion in the sample. This was distorted especially by the April events and the switch to Globex, because overnight price actions often generated significant gaps.However, after a downside touch, reversion occurred on average in 55.26% of cases. In the upside case, 36.59%; this characterizes the left‑tailed distribution well.Return to the geometric mean of the reversion bands after a downside hit occurred on average in 42.87% of cases, whereas after an upside hit only in 25.04%, and after an upside hit dispersion is higher and skewness is positive, which means that the higher the upside reversion band spot touches, the less likely spot is to return to the mean. In the downside‑hit case this dispersion is much smaller, and even at the lowest level it is above 33%. So the probability of downside level reversion is significantly higher.Weekly post and ranges:Upper level hit = 84.62%Lower level hit = 23.08%Trend shift (for the next week) after breaking the level = 69.23%Reversal after hitting lower level = 66.67%So the levels to the upside signal trend reversals well—exactly what they are meant to do. The lower levels most often function as reversion levels, but the sample size is small.The posts containing the weekly ranges also usually hinted at whether an upside or downside breakout from the range is expected, and whether overall I expect a bullish or bearish week. In this respect the hit rate turned out to be surprisingly high, around 66–69%. Based on the data, out of 13 weekly forecasts I correctly anticipated the next week’s trend direction in ~9 cases.Risk levelsThis is the strongest part. The definition of a risk level is that it is a trend‑fail filter, a kind of “make it or break it level.” So if price breaks through it, we can expect the trend to continue; if it rejects it, the trend does not continue.In the examined sample, acceptance at the upper risk was 62.90%, and at the lower risk 45.16%.When acceptance occurred, the day’s direction practically switched in a regime‑like way. In the case of upside acceptance, the mean return was +0.643% and the up‑day ratio was 94.87%, while in the case of lower acceptance the mean return was −0.881% and the up‑day ratio was only 10.71% (i.e., roughly 89% was a down‑day). This behavior fits the “make it or break it” interpretation exactly: with risk acceptance the day enters trend‑mode, therefore the classic mean‑reversion expectation (e.g., back to μ) weakens significantly. The average Close‑to‑Close effect for the next day was already more mixed (after upper hold average +0.290%, after lower hold average +0.418%), and it suggested that after lower‑risk acceptance a bounce often appears, whereas after upper‑risk‑level acceptance a more moderate follow‑through is seen.Macro predictions: Here the distribution is about 80% in the 0.6–0.8 band and 18–19% in the 0.8–1.0 band. The average is about 70.09–72.8%.My accurate forecasts preceded public sources by about 33% on average.61–71% of the accurate predictions appear before events with a median lead time of 56–61 days. (In the case of short‑term statements, this number disperses toward 77.7%.)These are extremely high ratios, especially in an area where predictability is made difficult by many unexpected factors (wars, election outcomes, diplomatic turns, energy‑policy developments, regulatory changes, etc.).Time evolution:All performance fluctuates, including mine. The magnitude of the fluctuation began to subside in the first half of May, and performance started to increase. This is distorted, however, by the fact that in the first period the intraday posts did not yet have a refined, standardized format. Toward the end of the year there were fewer exceptionally low‑accuracy (20–30%) days, and high hit‑rate (above 70%) days became more frequent. For weekly posts, performance rather stagnates at the levels described earlier, but it was strongest during the summer. Similarly, the accuracy of the geopolitical analyses also stagnates at high levels. So here a consistent methodology is present.Overall:The general average accuracy rate that can be converted into a trading edge falls between 59.64% and 61.38%, depending on weighting (equal weighted vs. level‑plus‑dynamics weighted information). But a friend of mine calculated a 59.20–65.29% interval. Method‑dependent. It is important to keep in mind that this is not a classic win‑rate (not “6 wins out of 10 trades”), but a 0–100 match score (combined score) that measures how closely the “map” described in the post played out in the market. This score simultaneously includes whether the specified levels actually came into play and how much the behavior/dynamics assigned to them (pivot reaction, centroid “magnet” characteristic, target‑fulfillment characteristic) were confirmed, and (if present) the bias/direction component as well.So if we hold everything constant, then, simplified, out of 12 months my analyses will be useful in 7.26 months, i.e., out of 252 trading days on 152 days the analyses will be accurate. So about 5 months, i.e., 100 days, when the analysis doesn’t help much. However, the degree of accuracy also fluctuates along a spectrum, the median of which is 58.33% (dispersing upward). On the other hand, under a more conservative model (sign‑on‑returns‑type, with the absolute value of normal returns) it indicates about a 1.84–2.54 annualized Sharpe, but under a more optimistic estimate (symmetric +1/−1 payoff for each signal, assuming a daily trade) 3.17 can also be derived. Both are significantly high values.(For comparison, the general accuracy rate of research desks is fluctuating around 40–50%.)I know this isn’t the 85-90% accuracy rate that most furus claim for themselves, but at least it’s true and well-auditable…The strongest points of my analyses, in order, are the macro context/bias, risk level, the speed profile levels (including weekly dynamics). Compared to these, the weekly ranges and reversion bands are weaker, but the accuracy still mostly disperses above the average, just only slightly. Some of my more important predictions from the past yearLet’s review a few of my higher-impact predictions from the past year…February–April window — I flagged the April drop days in advance, with then-unbelievable downside targets that were hit. Three days before it I calculated the bottom level to within 100 points (which, at 35.02% realized volatility, is well within a 1‑sigma daily range), and I said that this crash was one of the first signs of geopolitical restructuring — a “weighing machine” momentum in Graham’s sense (not simple speculation).I predicted “hidden QE” through Bessent’s bond market operations, and the rebound even if I didn’t expect such a sharp/fast rebound.Geopolitics -  I dedicated tons of posts for Trump’s geopolitical program: that there would be a US–Russia rapprochement via Gulf mediation, and that the EU would be pushed toward a national economic model (which is why they will run to China for help) — and all of that is now happening (see NSS for example). Furthermore, with sudden events, I helped interpret them—something that the majority of renowned and highly followed analysts failed to do—and my interpretations ultimately proved correct (like UA-peace plan, Trump-Putin meeting, Venezuela, US-EU conflict, or Warsh’s plans).Correction in May — My primary WoR ran from the May ECB rate decision to mid-May (Trump’s visit to the Middle East). We saw a ~97-point decline in SPX, but the market did not break my target level from which momentum could have flipped into left-tail risk.(Later, a 124-point decline materialized after Trump’s visit, but that wasn’t the risk I expected; it followed directly from weekly positioning with an exact target. The same applies to the 107-point decline in the 16–20 June week.)July/August window — Essentially my original major WoR: the post-NFP and FOMC period, once tariff effects began to show up in the data. I marked it into mid-August. The effects did start to appear, and we got a 215-point decline—still not a break of the level that would have triggered the left-tail risk I’d been flagging.(In mid-August another 138-point decline followed, but again the structure held. By mid-July it had also become clear to me that the market would remain supported, and I emphasised that my WoR was shifting towards the post-September OpEx period.)Bitcoin trend and levels - Back in July, I predicted the Bitcoin local top to happen in October, marking it as the highest probability top.Gold up - In early August I forecast that a new momentum phase would begin — back when gold was still only at $3500 (and I warned my subs for the selloff of the speculative rally, one day before it happened). Post-September OpEx — I called for supportive flows into Monday and the WoR starting on Tuesday: that produced a 130.3-point pullback. I then called for volatility and vomma supply, and for the week of 6 October I flagged weakness and a potential vol spike into the Thu–Fri window, which delivered a 213.8-point pullback.October 29 selloff - I publicly called it on twitter and called the bounce too at the bottom. It was a 398.42 pts selloff, and I called the bottom to tick and day just like in April.December rangebound - SPX barely made a 1.73% return since.BoJ rate policy-risk - Again, before it became a popular topic.And a lot of others along with micro flows… All things considered, I think there is still plenty of room for growth, and I also have ideas for the time that remains. But I believe we’re perhaps not on the wrong path, are we? I’d like to thank you once again for the trust and the tremendous support I’ve received from all of you.
