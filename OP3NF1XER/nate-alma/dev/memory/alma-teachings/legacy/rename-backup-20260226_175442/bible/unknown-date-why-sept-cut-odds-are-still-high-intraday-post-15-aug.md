Market analysisWhy Sept cut odds are still high? - Intraday post (15/Aug)Debt burden, Treasury issuance, Recession odds, OpExAug 15, 2025∙ Paid141ShareCore PPI come out quite hot confirming sticky inflationary pressures and tariff effects as we expected since April/May. PPI feeds into PCE more directly than CPI. Producer prices, especially trade services margins and core goods, tend to lead consumer inflation with a lag (weeks to a few months).Market is now waiting for the PCE data (Aug 29) but what the market priced in is starting to be realized, still… Why? Because 10 yr is expected to hover ~4.3% because of tariff worries and heavy Treasury supply (elevated term premium). This keeps financial conditions relatively tight even if the Fed trims the policy rate 25bp. Also July NFP… Fed repeatedly emphasized balancing risks when the labor side weakens, and tariff pass-through is seen as near-term and mainly in goods, as the charts from the linked post is also showing…The other problem is that even with a surge in customs receipts, July’s deficit still widened ~20% y/y, and Treasury debt is nearing $37T. Treasury supply is heavy but skewed to bills. Because long rates stay firm on supply & term-premium concerns (debt burden and ongoing issuance), a small cut doesn’t over-ease. MMF AUM is still growing. Fed cut would lower MMF yields, which could unlock some money out of cash over time. So, this Sept cut is expected to be a hawkish cut, then more cuts in 2026 as tariff effects start to fade. So the probability of malign outcomes of this August risk window eases, because debt burden must be managed first, and it is shifting towards the post-Sept OpEx/FOMC window, especially because a slow sell-off would ease the wealth-effect caused inflationary pressures, but stay cautious! No long-term positions for me. A market correction is timely, prices are temporaly high. But I don’t see bearish trend now, only high odds for a pullback.
