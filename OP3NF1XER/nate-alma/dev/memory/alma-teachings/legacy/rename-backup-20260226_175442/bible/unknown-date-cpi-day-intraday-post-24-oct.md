Energy helped headline earlier in the month, but gasoline +4.1% m/m was offset elsewhere; core eased with familiar pockets (goods softness, airfare dip) while tariff-exposed categories (apparel/furnishings) showed some pass-through. CPI alone won’t move the Fed; short index vol bias into/after print; SPX implied move ~0.6%.Consider selling front-month index premium against kept tails (e.g., calendars / put flies) given ongoing tariff/geopolitical headline risk. Why? SubscribeGEO RISKWe have new EU and US sanctions along with China tariffs…EU first-ever bans LNG, phased—short contracts cease in 6 months; all Russian LNG imports to end by Jan 1, 2027. Also targets shadow-fleet tankers (port/insurance restrictions), third-country banks/crypto that aid evasion, and diplomat movement curbs. While US Treasury (OFAC) sanctioned major Russian oil companies and signaled stepped-up enforcement on energy revenue channels. With the EU’s LNG phase-out locked in, Moscow will redirect cargoes to Asia and lean more on the shadow fleet; EU moves expand the list of sanctioned hulls and insurance/port access checks, raising freight & compliance costs.Cost-push inflation is still not off the table.However, the Fed is very much likely to QE in order to bail out the sentiment and the economy.We are in a good news are good news regime.
