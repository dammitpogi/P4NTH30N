Market analysisIntraday post (21/march) + OpExMar 21, 2025∙ Paid1711ShareIn this post you can read the overall bias from geo perspective. Crucial.This is the weekly post, covering the weekly positioning and more geo context.In this post I covered how the greeks interact near to expo (gamma, vega, vanna and charm).And this is from yesterday where I covered the current Fed and the tech situation.Very important to read through them.After Thursday’s price action, the SPX would need a roughly 4% rally to trigger both medium-term and short-term systematic buying levels. Once that occurs, nearly $70 billion of U.S. equities could be unlocked for purchase. Despite recent declines, market breadth is strong—which isn’t surprising if you understand the context I keep writing about.On the institutional side, however, hedge fund gross leverage is at an all‑time high. When prices dip, forced de‑grossing (i.e., selling) may happen, making trading choppy. The ratio of short sales to long sales is about 5.2 to 1, meaning there are over five short sales for every long sale. This large imbalance reflects a heavy bear skew in market sentiment. Of the 11 U.S. sectors, 7 were net sold. The recent drop in U.S. Fundamental L/S Net leverage to roughly two-year lows shows that the overall aggressiveness of long and short positions has fallen sharply.More importantly, the aggregate long/short ratio (longs divided by shorts) has hit its lowest level in over five years. The top sectors being sold were Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Financials—generally more cyclical or growth-oriented.All in all, the market remains full of uncertainty and high institutional leverage.In April, there are new tariffs scheduled for April 2nd and 15th, and Trump has already started discussing nuclear issues with Iran, which is a highly sensitive topic.There’s talk on Wall Street that real QE might arrive in May. I think this is still early, but if everything goes according to plan, it’s possible—though the market must drop significantly first. Meanwhile, funds plan to offset their significant losses through tax loss harvesting around April OpEx week—no coincidence there.A personal meeting between Putin and Trump is scheduled for after Ramadan and Eid.Volatility on a fixed-strike basis has significantly decreased going into April, and the skew is shorter. Complacency is always what leads to sharp declines, not when the market is hedged.I’m not sure what will happen between March OpEx and end of month. For now, I’m taking it day by day. But in any case, the bottom isn’t in yet—only a temporary one. Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
