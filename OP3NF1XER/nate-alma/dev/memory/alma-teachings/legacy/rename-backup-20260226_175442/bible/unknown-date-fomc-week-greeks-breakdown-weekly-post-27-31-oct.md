Market analysisFOMC week, Greeks breakdown - Weekly post (27-31/Oct)Oct 26, 2025∙ Paid28SharePERSONAL ANNOUNCEMENT:I won’t work on the Nov 3 week.I will send you the weekly post on Nov 2, and the next post will come on Nov 9, again weekly.Window of Risk: Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tellsAlma·September 18, 2025Read full storyDeflating risk in time?Last week the weekly positioning did not show fear, however I marked the post-VIX expo day as a downside acceleration potential as VIX dealers buyback their hedges and sell ES futures. We had a nice 98.1 point sell-off day on Wednesday. However I marked the weekly centroid as very importnat because speed, vanna and even zomma worked against downside acceleration if that level is held. Premarket intraday update showed us that it will be held well, kurtosis was heavily sold. Both for Oct 6 and Oct 13 weeks I predicted rangin for the first half of the week within a certain level then volatility spike into Thursday-Friday window. First time we got a 265.85 pts decline after ranging, second time we got a 139.3 pts sell-off. For the Oct 13 week, it was clear that the market sold both the left-tail and tailedness, and that it won’t break the structure. Market has chosen to hide risk through time-correction. The economic datas versus the reality and accumulated policy and geo risks that the market also feels, bids on it too but not enough, also proved that sentiment remains rigged. However, any policy escalation is dangerous. Not overly, you will see, that volatility (RV and IV to) remains under control, and they have every tools to do it, but still… Momentum-wise, the 6858.68 is the pivotal zone for this week, that can form a double top. Macro still supports quality risk but with geopolitical hedges. SubscribeFOMCConsensus is very strong for a 25 bps cut. Even tho the shutdown delayed key releases, markets still price a cut and the Fed is focused on the labor side of the mandate. This is key, because it is not healthy on the long-run, but bullish on equities and gold on the short-run. Stopping QT as soon as this meeting is also on the table, due to signs of funding frictions (see SRF usage spike last week) — a plumbing backstop, not stimulus. Core PCE expectations into Friday release is about +0.2% m/m after the softer 0.2% core CPI; historically core PCE tends to run a touch below core CPI on a monthly basis. Recent prints show 0.2–0.3% m/m as the live range. (August core PCE was +0.2% m/m.)And ~2.8–2.9% y/y (August was 2.9%). The September CPI outcome (core +0.2% m/m) nudged expectations toward the lower end of that band.For GDP the expectation is 3.8 - 3.9%, this is still ok for a cut.Don’t forget that the key problem what the admin aims to manage is the debt burden over inflation! QT halt could be signaled at the upcoming meeting to create a hidden stimulus. (Stopping runoff raises bank-reserve growth vs the counterfactual, lowering the risk of collateral squeezes/repo spikes. That cuts left-tail liquidity risk, which supports credit and equities even without QE.)If you see HY/IG spreads tightening while index vol compresses into buyback windows, you know what’s happening… SubscribeLet’s scrutinize the weekly fixed strike skew, volatility expectations and distribution, dealer positioning…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
