Things are changing even faster. Trump, Warsh & Duquesne Last week, Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. There has been extensive speculation about the significance of this move, because the prevailing narrative is that Warsh is a well‑known hawk. However, it is not that simple. Under Warsh, a “front‑end easing + back‑end discipline” regime will emerge—one that would favor a curve steepener, rising term premia, and increased vulnerability in liquidity hedges (gold/crypto). Warsh wants to support the real economy, but not through QE or balance‑sheet expansion, because that distorts price discovery, creates a “Fed put” perception, carries inflationary side effects, and is politically exposed.This regime also comes with an AI/productivity narrative and a Druckenmiller–Duquesne network backdrop. If you want to sell the idea that you can cut rates without triggering a renewed inflation scare, you need a “productivity step‑change (AI/tech)” story. Karp/Palantir is the poster child for that.But if balance‑sheet discipline pushes term premia higher, lifts long‑end yields, and the market begins to slide, then—by the internal logic of the Fed, the presidency, and the mandate—easing eventually becomes unavoidable. And that will happen soon.That’s the scheme here… Subscribe(In many places right now, the Karsan’s Lauder theory that leads nowhere is what’s circulating. And when, months later, they finally realize what I’m telling you now, they’ll present it as if they’d known it all along…)The market is very fragile this week, especially above the 6900 level. Traders are pricing supportive forces below the centroid, but more through the volatility channel than via a clear, spot‑based support line.We have ISM Manufacturing PMI on Monday, PMI on Wednesday and NFP on Friday: In this regime, datas are not that important. Market reacts on policy mostly. But we are in a “bad news is good news regime”: Momentum-wise, as long as SPX remains under 6976.35, pressure remains: Customers have increased their put buying activity there. The other momentum metrics also takes me to that level, saying 6976.74 weekly should be taken out in order to gain some positive imbalance. While below 6959.42, the market accumulates negative imbalance, marching towards equilibrium. SubscribeLet’s see, how the market relates to these key zones. WEEKLY POSTLet’s look at the weekly positioning: The net speed profile is flat to negative. Customers are selling volatility into both ways, however even tho there is more realized vol has been sold to the downside, the vol selling to the upside is more convex above 6917.81, so the effect can also be expected to be more aggressive. The centroid of the profile is in the 6835.28 - 6859.74 range. Upside pivot is at 7031.92,with target of 7063.24Downside pivot is at 6715.72with target of 6677.28Market wants to see spot breaking beyond 6772.55 or 6968.19, betting more on downside. Weekly max pain level is 6888.08Let’s look at the greeks exposures…Dealer exposureNet delta is negative, switching positive below the centroid, withNet charm being negative with an avg delta decay of 63.01% over the week, but switches positive below the centroid. Net gamma is negative, withNet color being negative, providing room for the realized volatility to increase. (It becomes positive locally only at 6540/50 and 7110/15)  Net zomma is positive until Friday. On Monday and Tuesday there is more zomma on ‘vol down’ moves (gamma down) than on ‘vol up’ moves. On Wed-Thu, zomma is kinda balanced, reversing the balance, and on Fri, the net exposure becomes negative, with asymmetry still towards the ‘vol down’ moves. This effect is the strongest between 6917 and the centroid zone (thats the zero zomma line too). Net vega is negative, withNet veta being positive. So the customers are long vol during the week, and they don’t switch, but the positive vega decay provides some passive vol selling flow, especially into Friday. Net vomma is negative and the effect increases into Thu. This means, that vol moves are amplified by dealer hedging, with asymmetric ultima towards downward vol moves, meaning that if vol goes down, vega goes up is like 6-10x times more than on ‘vol up’ moves. On the spot axis, vomma becomes postive below the centroid. Net vanna profile is net positive, switching to net negative into Friday. It flips during Thursday. The asymmetry of the vanna profile (zomma) tells me that the customers’ net long skew trade is more about selling upside vol than buying downside. This switches into Friday, when the net short skew trade is about dumping put premiums rather than bidding upside calls, however, the asymmetry is way lower. This also tells me that customers do actually mean that short veta trade into Friday, betting on the smirk being slightly suppressed.So, market sees shorter spot/vol beta, but also shorter IV/RV beta on IV down/RV up, until Friday. What market is betting on with its long skew trades is that call selling will go on and will be complacent, while it is ready to capitalize on downside moves, and it doesn’t expect at all on breaking through the downside target; it locally bets on short rel.vol heavily into Friday. Above the centroid, fragility is expected: in case of a risk off impulse, everything moves into the same direction. While below the centroid, spot meets passive supportive flows. So, overall, the market expects strong supportive forces below the centroid range towards the downside target. Above, the market sees very fragile and volatile environment, that it doesn’t expect to calm down. The OTM call selling is being seen as too aggressive and directly causing pressure on the spot (see vanna and zomma exposure), while it doesn’t see panic and bearish sentiment reversal, rather downside put decay again, with doesn’t really bet on too much upside. The overall bet hence is a rangebound, with net negative drift but not breaking the structure. Vomma model predicts6812.65 - 6853.21 for downside zone, and7001.27 - 7030.70 for upside zone. This is an asymmetry. The downside zone aligns just with the centroid zone, adding a 22.63 to it as “tolerance”. But it tells me that market doesn’t expect to reach the downside pivot, rather stabilizating around the centroid. To the upside, the zone is below the upside pivot, telling me, that market doesn’t expect it to be broken either, rather a reversion.Remember, that market bets that here the gamma becomes sharply positive locally, that can have a local pin effect in this zone. If the upside move has momentum with higher fuel to break into this range. So the nature ofthe two zones are different: in the downside zone, the forces that were fragility-creating previously, become supportive here providing a braking effect for the spot. Conversely in the upside zone, it is the localy sharp positive speed, that generates a high long gamma effect, that can be reversionish, if the move lacks momentum. Fixed strike skew shows decreased tail skew and slightly increased 22-delta skew coming from 22-delta put bid. Overall the whole smirk is up by 10.23% Not much, but it makes it rational to make the above-written skew trade. Sentiment expectationsSo all-in-all…Monday is expected to be moderated but anxious. Tuesday is expected to be more volatile, very headline sensitive, risk-off.Wednesday is expected to be cautiously more calm. Optimism during the AM and moderation during PM. Consolidation after Tue.Thursday is expected to be choppy, and hedging going on.Friday is expected to turn towards slightly more optimistic. Weekly position unwind, worthless downside hedges gonna be closed, providing some support. Risk appetit remains low.
