Market analysisNear-term outlook, Free-education about principles, Risk window - Intraday post (13/08)Furu mentality vs Advanced mentalityAug 13, 2025∙ Paid161ShareFor longer-term planningI still cautious with long-term positions because I want to see how the admin and US handles the tariff effects. For now, the core CPI doesn’t show disinflation at all, the opposite: sticky pressures, but market is up on the admin’s communication. Before sizing down the hedges I want to see PPI to confirm or disprove any trend, and to wait for Jackson Hole next week. As said yesterday, a print like this extends the risk window into Jackson Hole, but I’m overall bullish into September. (Basically imagine the chart I showed here, but instead of OpEx date, it is pushed forwards by a week, and downside target is 6095/6035)The Sept rate cut event will be interesting. If it happens, it can cause a melt up into 7k, but soon after the SPX will revert, simply because market knows that inflation is going up, and market should be up on economic performance not on speculative, mechanical buying flows. And future high inflation is actually bad for firms, industries, corporations. However, I don’t expect bear-marketish trend, only a repricing/reversion/buy-the-dip event. As you know, I overall bullish on a yearly term:Playing the AI-Bubble; Long-term outlook Alma·July 22, 2025Read full storyThe OpEx flows are still very supportive, downside volatility is well supplied, meaning, mechanically liquidity is generated there. Market outperformed the levels I gave in the weekly post, meaning the melt-up tendency is being confirmed. However, technically it is only a breakout, a strong one, but you need to see confirmation during this session, before decide to size up, or down on that. The breadth expanded well, and weekly vacuum-up is started as SPX has entered the “right-tail” range:With increased spot/vol beta:My target volatility level is 13.59% (currently the RV is at 10.16%), that would produce a melt-up towards 6570 SPX in the following week and 6600 into month-end. Interesting enough, these calculations pretty much align with a bigger channel targets: The reversion probability is at 88.36%, but I want to see 90/91% in order to have a high conviction mean reversion call. My risk window is not over yet…SubscribeNow, listen very-very-very carefully…Portfolio management, Mindset, DisclaimerI want to take this opportunity to explain that what I’m writing about isn’t about trying to guess where the market will go now. This is something I keep explaining to my subs since I’ve opened this Substack, but I still see a lot of misunderstanding about trading. The market is going up regardless—that isn’t in dispute. As you know, I expect a 65–72% rise during a Trump presidency, provided there is a rate cut and a ceasefire in Ukraine holds. The goal is to determine the near-term risk.My long-term portfolio makes up roughly 75% of my total managed wealth. Most of it is in domestic bonds and precious metals, and about one-third in equities and cryptoassets. I use around further 15% for swing and day trading (at max!), and keep roughly 10% in cash for emergency. These are rough estimates, but I try to maintain this weighting when I take profits. For me, trading is a supplemental source of income that I don’t use every day—only when I see good (high probability) opportunities. Most of my management is the continual rebalancing of the long-term portfolio. By that I mean I assess risks and set target levels at which I increase the weight of certain hedges relative to the underlying long exposure—and then do the reverse once risk has proved to be declined. The goal is wealth-building, not gambling. Trading is merely a way to create new capital that I can put into further investments. This overemphasis on day trading is a harmful mindset, driven by advertising and social-media hype. A lot of people are obsessed with having the highest possible hit rate. Most intraday moves are not reliably predictable. Sometimes they are, but more often not. What matters are levels that actually mean something. A trader should plan position sizing, define a max loss per trade, and decide in advance where to close or where to scale up. The hit rate isn’t what matters, risk management is. I wrote a whole educational post about it. If your hit rate is only 35%, that means 65 losing trades out of 100. Suppose you lose exactly 10 pts on each losing trade (your max loss). That’s 650 points down. On the remaining 35 winners, you need to make only 19 points each to end up +15 points after the 100th trade. In practice you won’t always lose exactly 10 (that’s your max loss-limit here), and you won’t always win only 19 pts because you scale up your winners. The point stands: strategy matters more than hit rate.The current trend is very fast and aggressive, yet illiquid. Illiquid trends are prone to tail events (in this case, a “vacuum-up” effect), but they don’t build a durable, long-term structure. Everybody feels and meassures the lack of stability in this rally. Building long-term positions into this trend is risky.My personal decision for now is to give up some slope in my long-term portfolio growth (because increased hedging may expire worthless) until I see a 5–6% correction. My present risk window is the PPI release and the Jackson Hole symposium. Reasons are explained. I want to see how the U.S. economy/policy handles the inflationary impact of tariffs. Either we get the correction here, or—if the communication is benign—the next risk window is the September FOMC, because after a rate cut the market will have to reprice itself. If there is a cut, it would be a hawkish cut. By then the SPX could reach 6600—or even 7000. I’ll detail this in the next weekend post. The key point is that the market is so heavily manipulated right now that it’s hard to state anything with high confidence. That’s why I’m waiting for roughly a 90% mean-reversion probability signal, which I’ll likely only get above 6500. In the meantime, I have my open bullish positions running since last week, hedged short-term with inexpensive OTM spreads with end-August and end-September expos. I’ll only increase their weight if spot breaks a few key price levels. This is something I keep telling since mid-July.I’ve provided some groundwork for these calculations in my educational posts—and will add more—because I increasingly see that most people aren’t actually managing a portfolio, they’re treating trading like a shooting range*. *By this what I mean is that some people keep trying to trade the market in advance—without any planning or risk management—before any momentum is actually confirmed. I place my trades based on probabilities, and I only reweight them once something has been validated. I emphasize this every day, and in February and March I even demonstrated it with live trading. I also pointed to books on probability-based betting strategies that explain how to achieve long-term growth in a highly stochastic system. But sometimes it feels like I’m talking to a brick wall. People keep just shooting blindly. The furus’ hit-rate-driven approach has done a lot of damage.Benjamin Graham’s book is a beautifull book… Let's scrutinize what Galton-board is being set for today… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
