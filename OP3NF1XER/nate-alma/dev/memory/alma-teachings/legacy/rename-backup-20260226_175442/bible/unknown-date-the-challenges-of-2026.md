Market analysisThe challenges of 2026Venezuela, US-CN, AI bubble, Geography, Inflation, Stagflation, CrisisJan 05, 2026∙ Paid4554ShareIn the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significant—yet still underpriced—risk in the market. These dynamics are already underway and will continue to play out, as many have written and as an increasing number are now writing, and they will set the tone for the period ahead.In 2025, in addition to corporate earnings, the market’s main engines were valuation expansion and fiscal and monetary stimulus, so a buy-the-dip approach broadly generated net positive returns. However, a number of challenges and risks have accumulated for the year ahead.In 2026, we should expect real interest rates to rise as inflation expectations fall at an accelerating pace, creating a drag on growth. And if labour-market trends continue, the liquidity support from further rate cuts will not necessarily offset a weakening macro backdrop. I think there is a strong likelihood that the Fed will pause its rate-cutting cycle in the first quarter of 2026, and then resume easing in June after a new chair takes office. Given the cooling in employment and the fading pass-through from tariff effects, a moderate degree of monetary easing can be expected in 2026. In addition, if the dollar were to weaken excessively, the yen could strengthen enough on a relative basis to compress (and potentially unwind) carry-trade activity, which is already a key risk factor for this year.The global portfolios are under re-structuring. The fact that, relative to gold, the S&P 500 is down by 29.33%, while in euro terms it is up only 3%, is a very serious warning sign for the future. (I would add that, relative to gold, the European equity index has outperformed U.S. equities by 23%.) It is very important to analyze how U.S. equities and U.S. bonds are behaving relative to gold and relative to the euro area, because that relative-performance and cross-currency lens can uncover meaningful hidden capital flows and repositioning.This move is an important sign of capital flowing out of the U.S., which has led to a global reshuffling of portfolios and greater diversification, and this trend is expected to continue.If the dollar’s purchasing power declines, beyond making imports more expensive and exports cheaper, it also means that the real value of claims denominated in fixed nominal amounts declines—even if their prices rise in nominal terms. Over the past year, long-duration U.S. Treasuries have generated a −33.33% return in gold terms.Record-low credit risk premia (tight credit spreads) suggest that expected equity returns will be low going forward.Corporate bond spreads have also tightened to record lows, which previously benefited both lower-quality bonds and equities, but by now there is not much room left for further spread compression. Overall, there is little scope for additional excess return from equity risk premia, credit spreads, and liquidity premia.And if Bessent fails to keep bond yields low and demand continues to weaken, yields may rise—which, with today’s overvalued asset prices, could trigger a very deep correction, potentially even a bear market.SubscribeReversion model flags 6,889.84 as the level that must hold for the rally to extend. There is no excessive short-term momentum on the horizon.On a multi-year basis, however, the model shows a 92.81% probability of a mean reversion below 6,000. In backtests, I typically need 95%+ to call a high-conviction topping signal, but this reading already helps explain why investors are in “sell-into-strength” mode.(These signals appeared in 2019, 2020, 2022, and again in 2025 ahead of the April crash)The market, as it stands today, is no longer suitable for investment: rotation is underway, while significant stagflation, credit, geopolitical, and social risks are accumulating.The problems are far deeper and longer-term than many believe. As I wrote several times in March and April, the reshaping of the geopolitical structure as we have known it has begun; the United States must fight to preserve its hegemonic role while also solving the challenges of a changing global economic order. These struggles are intensifying.The market is currently dominated by hedge funds and private multi-billionaire speculators, such as Soros, who know how to pocket as much as possible from an inflating bubble and from rising vomma risk before the bubble bursts.The market favors momentum traders and speculators. The portfolio strategies that worked previously no longer protect you.In this post, I will outline the nature of the risks and challenges, including Venezuela, the U.S.–China conflict, the dangers of the AI boom and the risk of a credit crisis, stagflation risk, and demographic change.SubscribeGeopolitics - the hidden kurtosisLet’s start with the most recent event: Venezuela…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
