Market analysisCPI and OpEx week - Weekly post (11/Aug - 15/Aug)Complacency, Stagflation, Momentum, OpEx flows, Levels and RangesAug 10, 2025∙ Paid241ShareHere, in the monthly post, I explained why I expect a move up with heavy vol selling during the week, also wrote that I expect post-OpEx strenght and stabilization into mid-Sept window, and called for a day-by-day approach for the week:Monthly outlook into Aug - Sept window + Weekly post (04/Aug - 08/Aug)Alma·August 3, 2025Read full storyDay’s were catched, and volatility was heavily sold. I explained that the “bulltrap” bias comes from the overconfidency about Sept cuts and looming geo risk. And after the market squeezed through the weekly range that the market was pricing in before Sunday open, and Trump tweeted, I wrote that the momentum can be extended, and one should take it serious, provided VIX range with heavy squeeze-risk, and said that until SPX cannot perform 6412 in a weekly avg, market is heading towards equilibrium: Bulltrap? VIX, Trump, Structure breakdown + Intraday post (05/Aug)Alma·August 5, 2025Read full storyToday this number is 6466.71 The message was basically to not be married to any side, because none of the trends are confirmed, and the Sept cut is hyped on only the NFP datas, that is not enough. Trump wants cut in order to unlock MMF money. Don’t chase here any side, just trade the upward move and the range patiently and wait until the risk settles or materializes. Vomma is sold, vanna is bid, so is speed while sentiment is still hyped. The market underprices the risk of inflation. The core inflation can be expected around +0.33% m/m and 3% y/y as the tariff effects start to appear in the datas, there is less immigrant and the global economy order is changing, while new taxes increase cost-push inflation, and also dollar keeps weakening:While it favors for exports and to inflate debt away, lower rates would weaken DXY more pushing inflation higher. And there were further heavy outflows from equities towards MMFs. SubscribeWe are knew that Trump wants weak dollar, low immigration, low yields, tax on imports, and also higher tech concentration. This is what the whole past-year Trump trade was all about. I wrote about it in my longer-term outlook. Everybody knew that this is inflationary. Then what is the problem? Growth and debt burden. Stagflation.Softening growth tempers pricing power, and market prices a 2.4-2.5% 5yr breakeven, a sticky inflationary pressure. Lower rates could ease debt service, support asset prices and draw some cash out of MMFs (even tho that money would mostly flow into bonds to lock high yield coupons first). But inflation is high even without tariffs. A logical move would be some upside correction in the dollar and the artificially prevented reversion in the markets to ease inflation pressures even on paper. So, Trump could blame Powell for that and push the Fed for a Sept cut.We will see… Let’s look at what the market is pricing in… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
