Market analysisAbove the line..., China vs US - Intraday post (25/April)Apr 25, 2025∙ Paid1522ShareAs I mentioned in this morning’s chat, Witkoff is currently in the Kremlin. Fresh development: in Balashikha, Major General Yaroslav Moskalik—deputy head of the Russian General Staff’s Operations Directorate—was killed by a car bomb. Putin has not yet responded. He knows the EU is trying to derail peace talks; he’ll react in due course.This makes negotiations much tougher, since it forces Putin to refuse any peace proposals. It’s now clear who really doesn’t want to negotiate…In any case, Trump and his team are still pushing, aiming May 9. Today is a critical moment. My sources said, that Putin is in good mood today, but he’s not known for forgiveness. It’s a difficult, unpredictable situation—let’s keep a close eye on the news. This is Trump's timeline for now. Very important to analyse, as it is always a message for the diplomats: Ceasefire “in two weeks” = implied deadline of May 9Witkoff in Kremlin = Steve Witkoff arrives in Moscow April 25 (assasination)Talks in Rome = Trump attends Pope Francis’s funeral April 26May 9 = target date for a tentative ceasefireSaudi trip = Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia May 13–16Each stop builds momentum toward a ceasefire; Trump said: “a lot of pressure on Russia” and suggested “it would be clear in two weeks”. Before heading to the Gulf, Trump will attend Pope Francis’s funeral in Rome,  where he can meet European leaders and press for unity behind his peace timeline (+ they will discuss tariffs). Immediately after that window, Trump goes to visit Saudi and Qatar/UAE on May 13–16, where he plans to unveil a $100 billion+ arms package.Rome’s funeral and the Saudi visit provide stages for bilateral side-talks.. something that is ideal for discreet pressure or concessions.As explained yesterday, China was lying about the talks. No deal, of course, but talks has been on under the surface. (I told you that I’m good at poker…)This is very important, because it means Trump and Xi may succeed in striking a deal with the EU whereby China withdraws its support from Europe. In exchange, they’ll strengthen their diplomatic ties. Remember that the Chinese Communist doctrine is compatible with a multipolar world order. And that the primal goals of the tariffs are about to force EU to negotiate. When it is done, tariffs will be cancelled. But for now they still play that poker game, and trying to waste US’ time as much as they can.If this turns out to be the case, then the U.S. will gain significant leverage towards Putin in the ceasefire negotiations. I hope you all appreciate just how risky all of this is…Datas coming next week, stagflationary pressures are still there. Negative wealth effect takes some time. ECB meeting is coming too, they will likely cut, as said before many times. And supply chain issued will also unfold: Data shows YoY drop in vessel calls and import volumes at the San Pedro Bay complex. Imports there could decline as early as May, following a 64% collapse in import bookings from China between March 24–31 and April 1–8, projecting more than a 44% drop in vessel calls in the week beginning May 4, compared with a year earlier. Maritime consultancy Drewry forecasts a 1% fall in global container port throughput due to US tariff policies. imports surged 11% year-over-year in March as shippers rushed goods in before tariff hikes; ship-traffic queues at West Coast ports down 44% this week versus late April. This causes an artificial lull in May arrivals, even potential masked stoppage. My sources say that the numbers will be worse…Global geo post;Weekly post My market call is… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
