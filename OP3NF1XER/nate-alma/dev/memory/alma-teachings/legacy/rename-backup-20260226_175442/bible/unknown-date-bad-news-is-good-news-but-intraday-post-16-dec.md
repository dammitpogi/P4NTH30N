Market analysisBad news is good news, but... - Intraday post (16/Dec)Dec 16, 2025∙ Paid9ShareWeekly post: OpEx, VIX expo, CPI and BoJ meeting - Weekly post (15-19/Dec)Alma·December 14, 2025Read full storyNFP is out, payrolls came out +64k vs +50k expected, that is slightly hotter on the headline job count. The rest was cooler. October roughly -105k and November +64k that is about -41k net over two months, that supports Fed pivot.As said, market sentiment is bad news are good news, meaning market does not have any growth scare now, they welcome any slowdown as it gives room and forces fed to stimulate the economy, exactly what the admin wants. I keep saying this since summer… SubscribeMarket is testing the gap. In yesterday chat I said, gap fill will most likely happen on NFP day. Overnight futs have touched the area, but ideally we should see a proper retest, otherwise it is like market is climing in thin air. It needs to have a ground below itself to have stability. For now a retest + rangebound would be ideal. I tell you why…If you look at the market returns, you can see that on a rolling one monthly basis market keeps underperforming its 6-months rolling retursn since Sept 2. Thats exactly the downside target since the post-Sept OpEx window of risk call, thats the most liquid and strongest area of the market right now. However, the returns can keep up if market rangebounds. As this market runs like a mathematical simulation of old-school boys, this hidden divergence could be reset.CPI is still ahead, futures did not went crazy on this data release, simply because NFP is not convincing. Let’s not forget that Powell said payroll gains had averaged about +40k/month since April, but that the Fed thinks there’s an overstatement of about ~60k/month in those payroll numbers—implying the “true” pace could be around -20k/month.If gap fill fails and sentiment shifts, market would retest that area. Low chance, but non-zero. Keep this in mind.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
