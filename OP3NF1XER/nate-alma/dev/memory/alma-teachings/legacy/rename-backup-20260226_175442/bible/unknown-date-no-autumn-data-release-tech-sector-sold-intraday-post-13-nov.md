Market analysisNo autumn data release, tech sector sold - Intraday post (13/Nov)Nov 13, 2025∙ Paid131ShareUpdated window of risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Alma·October 29, 2025Read full storyWeekly post: Geo and policy uncertainity is here - Weekly post (10-14/Nov)Alma·November 9, 2025Read full storyOn Tuesday night, I dropped a new educational post, in case you missed: Educational postsA Guide to Reading My Daily PostsAlma·November 11, 2025Every time you look at tools such as put/call deltas, ratios, or even monitor changes in order flow (e.g., the ratio between selling and buying volume), you get lagging data.Read full storySubscribeThe strange thing about the recent price actions is that market didn’t really go optimistic on the bill.
