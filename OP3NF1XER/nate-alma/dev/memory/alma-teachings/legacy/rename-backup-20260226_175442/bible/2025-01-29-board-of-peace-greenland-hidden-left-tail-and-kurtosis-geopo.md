I wasn’t wrong. I called it ahead of time.Board of PeaceThis week in Davos, Donald Trump’s next diplomatic bombshell is set to be unveiled: the ‘UN 2.0’ aka the “Board of Peace”, which—according to the U.S. plans, incidentally—would in effect be intended to replace the UN. The American act unfolding before our eyes is preparing the ground for a far bigger collapse of the known geopolitical architecture than the one it is supposedly being created to manage. The Chairman position is endowed with such broad and virtually unlimited powers that modern democratic institutional systems offer hardly any precedent for it—while history offers plenty. These are absolutist arrangements masquerading as constitutional: formal institutions (a Board, voting) exist, yet real power (vetoes, appointments, succession) is concentrated in the hands of a single individual, without any checks and balances whatsoever.The charter states, on the one hand, that the organization is not authorized to intervene unilaterally within the territory of a member state, and that member states may voluntarily withdraw. Yet a hegemonic trap is hidden here, because a hegemonic power has countless tools to coerce a state into joining the political structure it created—or, once it has joined, to ensure no one feels like leaving—or even to force ideological pivots on its partners (as in the present case, where the new national security strategy expects a Christian‑nationalist turn from Europe as well).I wrote many times last year about the importance of Christian‑nationalist ideology.It is no accident that Russia has indicated it received the invitation and would like to hold talks about it with its American partners. Nor is it an accident that the UAE has already accepted the invitation. Don’t you have some “holy alliance 2.0” and “Yalta conference 2.0” flashbacks? I talked a looot about them last year. Everything what I said, is happening… Geopolitics, tech, context for 2025Alma·March 2, 2025Read full storyIt is hardly surprising that a number of Western political leaders have voiced fundamental reservations, mainly on the grounds that such an alternative organization would undermine the UN’s legitimacy and functioning. However the UN’s effectiveness is very much undermined by the UN itself, And here we must immediately add that the UN member states could make the existing organization more effective as well—if that were truly the aim, and if they did not measure effectiveness by the success of enforcing their own corrupt interests.If Russia becomes ideologically palatable (a Christian‑conservative narrative) and is willing to cooperate with American leadership, then it may receive concessions (for example, on Ukraine). Ukraine’s future may thus, unfortunately, also become a function of such a behind‑the‑scenes bargain. Intelligence sources are obviously watching closely how open Putin is to participating in an alternative world order. SubscribeWhat is the purpose of all this?Well, personally, having studied the American collective psyche, I have found that America—unlike the Eastern world—is not imperial in disposition (not even at the level of ordinary people). The U.S. has typically been accused of imperialism for decades by the Russians, North Koreans, Chinese, and other authoritarian regimes, following the principle: “accuse your opponent of what you yourself are actually doing.”America thinks in terms of a global republic: countries are sovereign, decisions are made in a senate, and power ambitions—as well as initiatives that harm the global common good—are restrained. Thus, if a state is unwilling to compromise, it is compelled. This really is only one step away from dictatorship, but the essential difference lies in the underlying mindset: while the West thinks in terms of a republic, the East truly thinks in terms of an empire. It is no accident that in America, since 1776, the “United States” system has never been broken and never transformed into an empire—whereas in Europe and Asia, wars driven by imperial ambitions have been continuous over these 250 years. This is crucial to keep in mind, because in the long run it is the underlying ideology that determines the trajectory. Always. That is why I am not afraid of America’s intentions—even if Europe, shaped by its own grim historical memories, is frightened by this Board of Peace idea.The goal is for America to forge a Western world built on unified guidelines against Chinese ambitions. As I already wrote last year, Russia wants to free itself from China’s shackles and rejoin the West, regaining the former Soviet geopolitical sphere of influence. Neither the Arab world, nor America, nor Europe, nor Russia wants a Chinese superpower. Unity can bleed out China’s great‑power position. It is no accident that China, in this situation, is once again offering to “help” Europe—just as I predicted for you last April.The other problem they want to solve is the dismantling of cross‑border global capitalist networks. These are dangerous for nation‑states, because a significant share of financial flows is directed into the pockets of a few big‑capital owners, draining national economies. The only problem is that this is impossible within a capitalist economic system—because what is happening is precisely the point of capitalism. That requires a new economic system, which I have written about before. Preparations are underway, and Europe will oppose this to its last breath, because most of its leaders are corrupt and beholden to globalist big‑capital interests. The Board of Peace plan is the root for the Holy Alliance 2.0 that will result a new Yalta Conference to take Russia in and defeat China. This is the plan. SubscribeGreenlandTrump was already openly interested in buying Greenland in 2019, but the Danish government rejected it then—as it does now—so Trump will impose a 10% supplementary tariff from February 1 on products from several allied European countries (e.g., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland). From June 1 this would be raised to 25%, and it would be lifted only in the event of an agreement on Greenland’s “full purchase by the United States.”The reason is that China and Russia also have designs on Greenland, and Denmark is not capable of defending the island. According to some of my sources, it has been slowly ceded into the hands of Eastern powers for the simple reason of corruption. Think about the chinese Artic Silk Road or the russian Northern Sea Route. And Greenland is extremely important from a military‑strategic standpoint (radio stations, air defense, missile‑launch sites, observation posts, intelligence, etc.). In 2025, U.S. military counterintelligence operatives secretly mapped Greenland’s critical infrastructure—ports, airports, military bases—without the Danish government’s knowledge. Danish officials fear that the incident is part of broader American plans to acquire Greenland, even by force.The only problem is that in a West–East war Greenland really is a key strategic point, and on NATO’s behalf the United States must secure it and use it militarily in order to succeed against Eastern hegemonic ambitions.Then why does the EU resist? Written above…I think China will exploit an escalating U.S.–EU confrontation to make moves toward Taiwan if EU leaders accept China’s economic assistance. China, leveraging the psychological pressure on Europe that stems from Europe’s historical traumas, is presenting itself to the EU as an alternative to the United States. (As I said last year: in times of crisis, the left drifts toward the far left, and the right drifts toward the far right. We call the far left communism and the far right nationalism.) If Europe falls for the trap, China gains a massive advantage against America.At present, the crisis is unfolding in the geopolitical arena and in the ideological dimension. And it will not end until the world order is transformed. The challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5Read full storyMarketsFrom a market perspective, this means Europe can sell equities and U.S. Treasuries (possibly together with China) to exert pressure on Trump. This will not happen overnight, but it is entirely something to expect ahead of February OpEx if the tensions between the U.S. and the EU cannot be eased through diplomacy. The process, at a “warning shot” level, is already underway. But if it truly kicks off, we will once again witness a 20%+ black‑swan event, filling the May 9 of 2025 gap that is the key structural support of the whole rally and never been tested. Market already started to price in the new regime: gold is up, defense is up, and Japanese sovereign yields are up. That signals elevated long-term geopolitical risk, higher fiscal and term premia in sovereign duration (JGB yields), and a less reliable “cheap yen” backstop as BoJ normalization collides with fiscal politics, persistent—and even rising—inflation concerns, and a shift toward a “closed,” nationalist, government-driven economic regime.This rhymes with the pre–World War II era. The market is literally repricing this shift in world order right in front of your eyes. SubscribeFinancing the bubbleIn the meantime, Bessent also opened his mouth, thanks God, and he said everything I wrote in my early‑January article.Bessent said openly that what is needed is a Fed Chair who can work well—especially with the vice chair responsible for regulation—on further financial deregulation. This is not merely a personnel question; it is credit‑supply policy. If banks’ capital constraints/requirements are loosened, lending capacity increases, and it becomes easier to finance the capex boom (AI data centers, industry).Bessent also highlighted that the market did not panic; in fact, yields down/equities up and the MOVE Index is at a multi‑year low. This means the “cleanup” forced on the Fed could ultimately lead to looser financial conditions (at least in the short term). That is typically risk‑on.Bessent also argues that Trump’s economic policy is trade plus tax plus deregulation. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA) became law on July 4, and among other things it includes “no tax on tips/overtime/social security” elements. Full expensing/accelerated depreciation and new expensing mechanisms (bonus depreciation, “qualified production property,” etc.) reduce the after‑tax cost of investment, so logically they turbocharge investment appetite—exactly where the AI boom is capex‑intensive. Deregulation, meanwhile, unlocks roughly $2.5 trillion of additional bank lending capacity. This is the key to financing the bubble, because if big tech and its supply chain undertake data center/AI capex, corporate free cash flow (FCF) may deteriorate in the short term—so the system can only “absorb” it if credit is cheap and abundant (bank loans, bonds, private credit, structured products).The final point I want to stress is that, according to Bessent, nominal GDP could even run at 7–8% while being “noninflationary/disinflationary,” like the productivity boom of the 1990s. In other words: if you can persuade people that a high GDP print is not inflation, then the Fed doesn’t have to hit the brakes, the bond market won’t demand as large an inflation premium, and the equity market will buy the long‑duration story (AI, growth). But here comes the reality check: the BEA’s Q3 2025 GDP is indeed very strong—4.3% annualized real growth, which is a fact. At the same time, a number of analysts have pointed out from the GDP reports that inflationary pressure in the quarter did not necessarily ease (e.g., GDP price index / PCE dynamics).So, with the “1990s” analogy, Bessent is trying to bring the bond market and Fed expectations into line with the growth program.Bessent’s story is a conditional chain. If any condition breaks, stress arrives suddenly. If inflation comes back (tariff pass‑through, wages/energy, services), then the “disinflationary boom” narrative breaks; the bond market demands a higher term premium, which pushes yields up, which makes financing more expensive. And if banks are unwilling to lend more (NPLs/delinquencies, spread widening, recession fears), then the $2.5T “capacity” remains on paper.That is a very fat, hidden left‑tail risk with an even higher kurtosis embedded in the market.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

I have a question with S&P 100 (mega-cap stocks) to S&P 500 ratio closing at 0.949 on Tuesday below its 200-day moving average, do you see more weakness in mega caps and mag 7 i.e. repricing/weakness continues? With earnings and sitting at the 200 dma could we get a bounce? LikeReplyShare
