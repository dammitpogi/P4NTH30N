Market analysisShort vanna, short veta, short fly - Weekly post (06-10/Oct)Oct 05, 2025∙ Paid151ShareWindow of Risk: Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tellsAlma·September 18, 2025Read full storyAfter last week 130.3 pts pullback from Tuesday to the level that the reversion model signaled as primal signal  (aligning with my call, but “no downside confirmation, as written) the risk was tempered a bit but only a little-bit. Then shutdown occured…U.S. equity funds took in $36.4B over the past week (largest since Nov ’24), heavily into large-caps; small/mid saw outflows; short-to-intermediate Treasury funds saw large outflows. Risk-on—at least in cap-weighted beta, short are being squeezed. Macro is supported now.Shutdown dominates near-term focus, historically shutdowns rarely derail rallies. Earnings next.The big-cap inflow keeps broad beta supported even with thin macro data—until earnings or a prolonged shutdown re-prices things. Dispersion-friendly structures (single-name vs index) and defined-risk downside (put spreads) into any shutdown headline shock. SubscribeI also want to citate my Thursday post here about GLD rally…“For portfolio managers:The current gold rally is chiefly supported by central banks + ETF demand, and (statistically) that rates lead gold, not ETF flows or the dollar. The Fed’s easing bias and upside risk to breakevens are the bullish pillars.Gold is effectively short beta to real yields, so the biggest left-tail is a real-yield backup / curve steepener—that’s what we should hedge.Gold doesn’t produce cash flow and is prone to regime swings. It’s a hedge/insurance, not a compounding engine. So, treat gold as exposure to inflation/real-rate factors rather than an “asset class.” Size it by risk budget and factor diversification, not notional. Manage the overlap with duration/ breakeven risk in the rest of the portfolio, so you don’t double up on the same macro bet.Measure your portfolio’s gold to real-rate beta: regress Δgold vs Δ10y TIPS yield and vs Δbreakeven; update rolling. Adjust rates-up hedges to the beta. TY/US put spreads (short 10y/long-bond futures via puts) sized by DV01 to your estimated gold–rates beta (mind vol risk!). Or bear-steepener options (2s10s/5s30s payer spreads) to cover a potential curve-steepening risk… GLD/XAU puts or collars (e.g., 3–6M 25Δ put financed with a 10–15Δ call sale) to protect against ETF-inflow stall/reversal. Because downside is on the table if ETF inflows stop.Or if you’re not set up to manage rate hedges, consider simpler collars or a multi-asset inflation sleeve (gold + TIPS + commodities) to diversify the bet.” SubscribeNow, let’s analyse what the current weekly positioning implies…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
