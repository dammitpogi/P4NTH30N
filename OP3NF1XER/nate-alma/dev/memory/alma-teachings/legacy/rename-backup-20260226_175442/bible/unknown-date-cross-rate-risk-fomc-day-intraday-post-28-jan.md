Market analysisCross-rate risk, FOMC Day | Intraday post (28/Jan) Free postJan 28, 2026∙ Paid121ShareA new free educational post will be shared after US market close. Topic is market principles, Soros’s reflexivity. Very important topic!Weekly post: FOMC Week, long zomma/short vomma | Weekly post (26-30/Jan)Alma·Jan 25Read full storyI dropped a very important broader macro and micro market report containing institutionals, geo, yen etc-etc.: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026Alma·Jan 23Read full storyI’d like to draw your attention to my latest post on Twitter here.Very important.To be honest with you, I barely traded US markets these days since OpEx, as my currency is Euro.
