I’m on it…Until I won’t post the usual speed profile breakdowns, but will go more technical and OD chart-based. For SPX,as you know, I expected a pullback, a deeper correction (6-10%) in order to wash out the risk properly to build a more sustainable structure for the coming months. Now, it seems like happening finally on the spot level too not just time correction. The best would be if SPX would be let to give it to 6390/6450 area that I marked in my Window of Risk post to give a higher confidence rally until late Q1/early Q2 (March-April window).My primal upside target after this pullback (if the SPX stabilizes at my bottom target, and not breaks below the February highs) is 7146.88; but also see 7270/80 to play out. The more “scary” the recent pullback is, the higher the market can go after. On the weekly basis, my pov is simple:As I covered, I think Friday rebound was kinda too early while it wasn’t enough to take out the upside target areas to mitigate the bearish pressure on the spot. My bias is that the bottoming process will start to occur during Monday and Tuesday, including sentiment. While in these next two days, the market can give us the original bottom target.However, I must note that if the sentiment does not coming up, the market remains headline sensitive, and if the consolidation fails in this ranges and volatility makes higher lows here, we could see the 10% pullback down to the 200-VWMA and ~6220 with a sharp high volatility decline (like in the case of an ending diag).This is way less likely in my pov, but I must note it, because it is a probability and policy now is unpredictable. The consolidation pattern should show lowering volatility locally while taking out the Thursday highs first. If structure is built beside low RV, the odds are increased to go and take out the marked upside area where the bearish pressure eases and market can start to march higher. I think it is also a lower probability to happen this week, I see it to happen once the Fed “bails out the sentiment” over the next week. I find it pretty likely monitoring the timing of the announcements and reactions. The highest probability for the week is to build structure at the bottom target at max, and starting to march higher into the next week. The key takeaway here is that the pullback provide us a nice BTD opportunity.The reason I don’t want to short this anymore is because 1) got a decent profit already, 2) reversion probability is above 50% (even 68%+) quantitatively. I’m not bearish near to the local bottoms, and the 10% scenario is too uncertain to make any proper bets. I’m not into taking unnecessary risk. Watch if VIX can take out the lower bound of the weekly range! That will be the tell. SubscribeFor GOLD the pov is similar. Bearish pressure remains until the market cannot take out 4145/4245, that I see less likely now. But overall would confirm the pattern that it wants to retest 3920 first, and potentially the 200-VWMA. Bitcoin is at a local pivot, from where a retest of 102k and my initial 112-115k area is the most likely scenario. It is simply because volatility cannot be let extend further now, and volatility is meassured through spot and time.However a failed rally into 112-115k area would confirm the bear-trend. This is logical as the broad market is risk-off, breadth is horrible. As you know, my pov is that BTC will go down to 50k where I will start to buy again and increase its weight in my portfolio as fundamentals have changed. Honestly, I don’t know if it will give one more hit to the highs over the next few weeks/months. 112-115k area retest will show us, and I don’t even care. Statistically, one more leg up is likely, but I don’t want to time the absolute bottoming of it. When it gives my downside targets, I will start to re-accumulate.
