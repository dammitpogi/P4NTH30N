Both British and Arab intelligence agencies are unanimously attempting to dissuade him from any kind of military operation, particularly during Ramadan (a window lasting approximately until the March OpEx), as such an action would directly ignite a jihad in the region and lead to an Arab Spring 2.0.Such an operation would precipitate a localized humanitarian disaster, massively drive up oil prices (especially since Arab oil refineries and shadow fleets would also sustain damage), and further exacerbate supply chain disruptions, all of which would collectively deepen Western stagflation.This, in turn, would provide China with an opportunity to enforce a blockade along the First Island Chain, exerting further pressure on Trump (which would bolster the Democrats’ position domestically). The crack spread (long gasoil/short Brent) shows bid on March and May contract:The spread is above its 95th percentile since November correction, signaling steep backwardation.And this comes from gasoil, that means refinery margin, distillate premium.Meanwhile, in contrast to this, the Brent front-month versus 6-month spread has been trending lower since June last year. This is a serious divergence…On the one hand, this signals the risk of supply disruptions; on the other hand, it indicates that the regime continues to adapt.Brent shows massive call demand for May 26 expiry:So does gasoil:The geopolitical and global economic risks of this would be immense, as it would drastically degrade the negotiating leverage of the United States on a global scale. SubscribeThe risk of any military operationLet me outline how the assessment of such a strike is conducted. The success of the intervention hinges on whether the Washington-backed son of the Shah is capable of forging the opposition into a unified front and sufficiently undermining the Ayatollah’s grip on power. However, intelligence agencies cannot gather exact data on this; they can only rely on probabilities. This was also the case in 1979, when U.S. intelligence deceived itself by seeing only what it wanted to see in the data. The U.S. military is unequivocally robust enough to execute the operation, but the focal point of the assessment is whether it would actually yield the expected results or merely further destabilize the environment. Unfortunately, Trump waited too long here; the regime has adapted, closed ranks even more tightly after the initial tremors, and prepared for American intervention. So timing is lost. Iran is buying time through negotiation to get fully prepared after RamadanTo comprehend Middle Eastern conflicts, one must understand that their roots are fundamentally ideological, rather than diplomatic or economic. The latter are merely secondary, sometimes entirely fabricated pretexts. Factions are held together precisely by these ideologies; if an individual emerges who can take the helm and authentically represent the most widely accepted ideology, they can forge the group into a cohesive bloc. Therefore, the critical question intelligence agencies must currently evaluate is whether the opposition’s faith in Persian culture and the unifying authority of the Shah are at least as strong as the fear of the Islamic religion and the believers’ loyalty to their group. (This is especially pertinent given that the plunge of the rial is due to an artificial dollar shortage engineered by the U.S. In such scenarios, autocratic regimes typically adopt a victimhood posture.) Without this ideological counterbalance, the regime cannot be overthrown, and a Venezuela-style operation would only result in a power vacuum and civil war.It is crucial to understand that the driving force behind the idea of an American intervention is Israel, which seeks to guarantee its own security through the preemptive dismantling of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, because the roots of power are inherently ideological, regime change is essential for long-term success. An American strike would undoubtedly cause destabilization, but it could subsequently foster stronger cohesion within the system. This probability is remarkably high, as this is exactly what is currently observable. The loyalty of the security forces remains steadfast; moreover, they have proven their allegiance to the regime. Preparations for succession are proceeding without conflict, there is no internal strife within the regime stemming from the crisis, official communication is disciplined and consistent (showing no signs of panic or disarray), and the repressive apparatus shows no signs of fatigue, continuing to employ lethal force and internet blackouts. Furthermore, the opposition demographic driving the intent for regime change is highly fragmented. Acceptance of the Shah’s son is by no means unanimous, either among the diaspora or Iranians living at home, and the protest coalition is heavily fractured and episodic, failing to genuinely aggregate into a unified bloc. Finally, Iran is actively preparing for an American military operation (efforts include dispersing leadership and command-and-control centers over a broader area, maintaining heightened readiness in the Strait of Hormuz, burying tunnels in Isfahan, reinforcing the Pickaxe Mountain entrances near Natanz, and implementing “concrete sarcophagus”-style coverings at Parchin, among other measures). As long as the aforementioned factors do not exhibit structural cracks, any form of external intervention will prove futile. The initial conditions were favorable, but Trump waited too long.
