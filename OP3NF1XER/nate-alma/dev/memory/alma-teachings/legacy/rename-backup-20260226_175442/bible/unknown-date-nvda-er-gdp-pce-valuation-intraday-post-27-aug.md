Market analysisNVDA ER, GDP, PCE, Valuation - Intraday post (27/Aug)ExpectationsAug 27, 2025∙ Paid8ShareMarket is waiting for NVDA ER, GDP and PCE… Weekly post: Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)Alma·August 24, 2025Last week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.Read full storyThe NVDA expectations are about $46 billion in revenue and roughly $1.00–$1.02 per share in adjusted EPS. It is expected to beat both top-line and bottom-line expectations and to guide Q3 revenue in the low–$50s billion range, because of the surging demand for Nvidia’s AI‑focused data‑centre GPUs, which accounted for about $39 billion of the company’s $44 billion revenue last quarter, and strong orders from hyperscalers and enterprise customers.NVDA is priced rich, it is trading around 55× trailing earnings and about 10 × sales. The PEG ratio is close to 0.7, which indicates that the current price-to-earnings multiple is only justified if the growth trajectory remains unbroken.The risk investors are watching is the impact of U.S. export restrictions on high‑end AI chips to China (which Nvidia estimated could lower Q2 revenue by up to $8 billion), and the sustainability of supply-chain capacity for new “Blackwell” and “Rubin” chips, and whether cloud providers’ capital‑expenditure plans will continue to rise. Any indication that demand is moderating or that margins are under pressure could trigger a meaningful correction because the stock leaves little room for error. In my view, NVDA is trading at its intrinsic value range ($170-200 range) pricing in very high growth, but if GDP is bad, this growth this pricing will become overoptimistic. For me the current valuation offers a slim margin of safety, so I want to see a pullback before buying again. Reversion probability is about 86.90% with target of 171.20GDPThe real GDP is expected to grow at at an annualized 3.0% in Q2 2025 with minimal revision (consensus looks for no change, or only a slight moderation).This is supported by stronger personal consumption and a sharp decline in imports, which mechanically boosted GDP because imports are subtracted in the GDP formula.PCEJuly core PCE is estimated at +0.3% MoM, some estimate that it could even be a hair lower (~0.24–0.25%), expecting YoY core 2.8-3% PCE. Also note, if Lisa Cook can be fired, Trump gains full control over the Fed. Datas will then serve his interest and bubble would be start to get inflated hard.ValuationSPX’ forward price‑to‑earnings ratio is around 20-23x, while the 10‑year Treasury yield is around 4 %. This implies an earnings yield near 4 %—not far above bond yields. This means that stocks offer little margin for error.The current P/E would only be justified if long‑term earnings growth were 5–6% higher than projected nominal GDP growth. So the market is pricing in a very rosy scenario for profits and productivity. Risk/reward is more balanced than in cheaper markets. This is why I don’t like longer-term positions now, and wait patiently. Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.
