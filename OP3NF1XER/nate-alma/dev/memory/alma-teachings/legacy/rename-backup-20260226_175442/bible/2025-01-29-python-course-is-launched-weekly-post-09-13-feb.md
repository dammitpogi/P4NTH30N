Market analysisPython course is launched | Weekly post (09-13/Feb)Feb 08, 2026141ShareI’m happy to announce that the Python course is now available on my website for all paid subscribers. See details by clicking on the link.Next week I will drop a post about fundamental analysis on BTC, explaining more in details what I already wrote last-year.  Please read these posts, carefully! The challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5Read full storyEarning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026Alma·Jan 23Read full storyWe have NFP and CPI datas this week.Market sentiment is “good news is not too bad news” and vice versa. Slightly weak or stagnant NFP is tolerated, but the key is that market wants to see the “Goldilocks” case, so that data should imply need/rrom for rate cuts. But not too much, as the signs in the supply-chain are there, like copper supply is under risk. Market started to see that the tech growth won’t be sustainable on the long-run this way, so the growth slows despite the USD weakness that provided a mechanical increase in market value. When market recognizes that most of the demand comes from the infrastructure-built, thats when the bubble bursts. SubscribeFor this week, what you must watch is how ES behaves at 7005 and 6960/70 zones. This zone remains as a major pivot, confirming/disproving moves. If 7000/05 keeps being rejected, my only speculative buying target is 6910/20 zone. For NDX, this is what you must watch:Shock factor is rising… Let’s look at the weekly volatility positioning… WEEKLY POSTCoding weekly positioning:Speed profile is flat-to-positive. It may look contraintuitive based on the pic, but customers are buying vol into both direction around 6933.88, but like 1.25x more volatility is being bought to the downside. Centroid is at 6982.65 Upside pivot = 6976.29Upside targe = 7051.22 Downside pivot = 6930.38Downside target = 6719.67This is a very fragile exposure. Customers are not too confidently betting on ranging in the 6869.62 - 6984.62 during the week (close enough to the vol based ranges, see below). Beyond these levels, pain trade comes into play. Market is net hedging downside, hence the far downside target, but locally it sold a put spread into the week, below this given range. Dealer exposureNet gamma is positive, meaning net bet is short realized volatility, with hedging the left-tail. Net color is positive into Wednesday then it shifts to negative, but gamma remains positive at the ATM strikes. Net zomma is negative, meaning positive IV/RV relationship. (I attached the snapshop of the net zomma effect in the 6810.0 - 7025.0 range.) Zomma is kinda flat symmetric into Thursday, when its effect goes up heavily. So right after when the net short RV trade peaks. So here, seems like market expects rangebounding swings getting wider. Into Friday, zomma effect gets flat and net positive: gamma declines on both IV moves, but more deline on ‘vol down’ moves, hinting an unclench into Friday trapping the ones who bet on a Friday pin.Net vega exposure is also positive, telling me that the base trade is short vol, however,Net color is net negative, becoming significantly more convex after Wednesday. And this is consistent with what the speed profile hints. Net vomma is negative, with a slight asymmetry towards ‘vol down’ moves by ultima. The effect grows and significantly jumps into Thursday, and - similarly to zomma - int shift to positive into Friday, but even higher impact. This is helps vol crush if any, but also exagerates vol up moves, however based on ultima, market’s primal bet is ‘vol down’. The profile remains asymmetric into Friday too, towards ‘vol down’ move, but in a long vomma profile it means, that path of the least resistance is vol up. This also hints like market foreshadows a flat reversion in vol into Friday.Net vanna is positive, meaning customers are long skew, and there is a slight asymmetry towards ‘vol down’ moves into Wednesday, and on Thursday it shifts towards ‘vol up’ moves. Even tho the asymmetry is flat until Wednesday, it tells me that customers’ primal bet is short call vol until Wednesday, then they shift towards long put vol into Friday.The common thing across the exposures is that the peak vol bet falls into Thursday. Fixed strike skew shows very flat 0.54% increase at 22-delta strikes coming from put buying, and a -9.57% decrease at the tails, coming from stronger 22-delta put demand. Smirk convexity is also up by 103.43% from being negative for a longer time, now it is back to flat, meaning customers are longer vomma, that is consistent with the long skew trade, but no bear-panic. Vomma model shows7004.41 - 7038.49 upside zone in case of vol crush that the market prices in, and6789.12 - 6835.08 downside zone in case of vol up. This is a 34.84% difference. Way lower than what the speed profile implies (82.57%). This high discrepancy tells me that the market expects a way thinner left-tail than what the actual convexity makes possible! And this is very dangerous, as vomma is negative until Friday. So the downside vomma zone is a major pivot that can catch many participants off-guard.So all-in-all, the derived sentiment is: Monday: cautious risk-appetite, false breakouts, benign stabilization exists but tends to show up as reversal mechanics, not smooth trend.Tuesday: slightly more benign, valuatino discrepancy, headline anxiety. Ranging.Wednesday: data-reactive, but market is leaning towards positiveness anyway. Cautious risk-appetite.Thursday: risk-off pivot, defensive rotationFriday: looks like CPI will be forced to be interpretet as expansionary, building long-term risk into the markets. Reactions are expected to be exagerated.Let’s look at the weekly vol-based sentiment pivot ranges: SPX:  7007.41 -  6857.19; vol based margin of error bounds:  7043.75,  6820.85ES:  7029.53 -  6875.97; vol based margin of error bounds:  7066.67,  6838.83SPY:  698.28 -  682.96; vol based margin of error bounds:  701.98,  679.26VIX:  19.43 -  16.09; vol based margin of error bounds:  20.23,  15.29IWM:  269.69 -  260.35; vol based margin of error bounds:  271.95,  258.09QQQ:  619.47 -  599.83; vol based margin of error bounds:  624.22,  595.08NDX:  25472.22 -  24679.32; vol based margin of error bounds:  25663.97,  24487.57NQ:  25565.39 -  24761.11; vol based margin of error bounds:  25759.90,  24566.60NVDA:  192.39 -  178.43; vol based margin of error bounds:  195.77,  175.05AMZN:  217.30 -  203.34; vol based margin of error bounds:  220.67,  199.97AAPL:  283.10 -  273.14; vol based margin of error bounds:  285.51,  270.73GOOG:  332.48 -  313.72; vol based margin of error bounds:  337.01,  309.19META:  678.25 -  644.67; vol based margin of error bounds:  686.37,  636.55TSLA:  424.74 -  397.48; vol based margin of error bounds:  431.34,  390.88TSM:  359.75 -  337.95; vol based margin of error bounds:  365.03,  332.67AMD:  219.39 -  197.49; vol based margin of error bounds:  224.69,  192.19GC:  5282.14 -  4975.06; vol based margin of error bounds:  5356.40,  4900.80SI:  86.64 -  73.36; vol based margin of error bounds:  89.86,  70.14TLT:  88.14 -  86.94; vol based margin of error bounds:  88.43,  86.65ZB:  116.30 -  114.70; vol based margin of error bounds:  116.69,  114.31 Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.14 Likes141SharePreviousNext
