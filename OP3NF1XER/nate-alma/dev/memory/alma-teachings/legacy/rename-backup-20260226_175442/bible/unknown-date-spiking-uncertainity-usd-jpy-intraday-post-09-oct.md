Global growth will slow only slightly this year and next. The AI optimism, tight credit spreads, earlier USD slide easing USD borrowers’ strains, tariff shock being smaller than feared for now, and private sector adaptability are all supportive on the short-run.However, equity prices are approaching late-1990s dot-com levels (in terms of sigma) and so a sharp correction would tighten financial conditions and hit growth, especially in developing economies. Plus monetary gold now exceeds one-fifth of official reserves (the central-bank bid narrative that’s supported this year’s rally- as I predicted in April), and the risk of margin compression that could flip to consumer passthrough, rekindling inflation is still looming. Tight spreads are part of why conditions feel easy. The implied risk is gap-risk if equities correct. That tilts institutional credit positioning toward higher-quality carry, shorter spread duration, and systematic hedges (index puts/CDX) into event windows. ’Buffett indicator’ (total market cap vs GDP) shows 221.54% today. It is very out of reality. The current situation favors more dispersion in equities. Uncertainity is unusually high, while global debt is marching above 100% of GDP during the next 4 years window. If US tackles the structural federal deficit and incentivize household saving (e.g., retirement tax preferences), that is supportive on the long-run. SubscribeWith the USD stalling, flows are gravitating to EM and carry. The U.S. data blackout keeps uncertainty high; when Washington reopens, they expect softer momentum in the macro tape, which could cap further USD gains.France is in flux after PM Sébastien Lecornu resigned; Macron is set to name a new PM within ~48 hours. Importantly, snap elections look less likely than they did earlier in the week. The euro broke its 100-day and momentum accounts had to adjust. We should consider trimming shorts near 1.1580/50, but stay medium-term USD-bearish and open to flipping later.USD/JPY move looks overextended absent fresh data. The LDP elected Sanae Takaichi, prompting a JPY slide as markets priced easier fiscal stances; large banks also cooled on near-term JPY longs. 155 would be a danger zone for Japan’s MoF (intervention risk), and flag near levels: minor resistance 153.70/80, bigger at 154.90/00; support 151.20/30. Cross-JPY (e.g. CHFJPY, EURJPY) still pushing highs.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
