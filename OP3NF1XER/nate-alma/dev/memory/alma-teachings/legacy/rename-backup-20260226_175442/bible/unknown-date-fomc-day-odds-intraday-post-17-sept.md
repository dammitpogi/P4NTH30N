With these prices - if we assume that the house always fakes the odds to get a favorable expected value - this means that Wall Street prices a left-tailish day, opposite to what the positioning says. They basically say that the market will not give it to the gamblers who are buyers of the upside bets. And this aligns with that slightly negative-to-netural SPX/yields beta, making algos to read the cut as “not too bad news”.
