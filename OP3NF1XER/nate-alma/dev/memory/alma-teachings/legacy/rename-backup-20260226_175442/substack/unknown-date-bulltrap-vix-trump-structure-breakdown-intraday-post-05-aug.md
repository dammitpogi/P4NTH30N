Market analysisBulltrap? VIX, Trump, Structure breakdown + Intraday post (05/Aug)Aug 05, 2025∙ Paid142ShareMonthly-weekly post: Monthly outlook into Aug - Sept window + Weekly post (04/Aug - 08/Aug)Alma·August 3, 2025Read full storyIn yesterday post, I warned you that the downside move is not yet proved technically, and called for right-tail and bull-trap bet that will materialize if the SPX is strong above a certain line. It opened above that, it got vacuumed up, and I updated the levels in the chat. After the session, we discussed the significance of the term ‘bull-trap’. Read this thread, please…There are two things, we need to scrutinize today. The first is, the fact that market rallied out of the range that the market were pricing in for the week, and its significance,and the second is, DJ Trump‘s tweet: Let’s start with DJ…As I said in April and May, I say it again: when the President of the United States posts something like this, you have to seriously consider it. The tweet aligns with my bulltrap call during this week, that me personally expect to be more like a ranging than a rally, but yesterday’s price action had a significant message…But Trump’s tweets in itself are not a guarantee that the market will go sharply up from now into the infinity. He is a sentiment manipulator! Keep that in mind. In the 2018/2020 period, he tweeted a lot, and most of the times the rallies were insignificant, and sometimes they were just right before a major pullback (was more rarely, but it happened). So, it is not an indicator for anything. One example:In my monthly/weekly post, I told you that they will manage the volatility, and won’t let the market to expand too big. Also said, that positioning says that volatility will be suppressed for this week, and vol of vol is gonna be managed during the month, in order to avoid sharp rebalances in VCs and CTAs…)This means, they are working hard to prevent a black-swan, but to create a slow sell, in order to make the Fed fold is strategical, this is why monitoring Fed’s stance is crucial. But as said, the problem is not solely the rates and looming contraction, but also the looming geopolitical problems and inland political tensions in the US. My next risk target for volatility leg-up remains the Friday-to-OpEx week window, especially the weekend (most geo stuffs are timed into weekends in order to get a hard time to catch the move). Note, that the rate cut bets spiked on the labour market datas, even tho it is not what the Fed wants to see for a cut; market is too complacent… We have PMI today, and CPI next week, and if disinflation trend is not proved, that 88.2% will get washed out of the markets. Listen, structurally…the volume is low. The lift that occured before the drop (especially in the tech sector) got taken back just within 2 days. The spot is testing the upper bound of the channel. This is pivotal, because the channel is the no-mans-land (imagine this channel more like a 2-dimensional trendline!).Considering Trump’s tweet, and the fact that market got agressively squeezed out of both the weekly range and the above showed channel, and even despite this, the overnight trend did not take out the upward purple line, is a clear sign for a trappish setup. I repeat: I expect the trap to materialize during the week. Mostly in a form of ranging, but Trump’s tweet even poses the possibility for a double top. I don’t know... All I know is that below 6416.01 (and even with an avg 5 days price of this), the market is heading towards equilibrium from where negative returns will starts to get accumulated. But in order to avoid a black-swan, sentiment must be calmed.I took shorts in the range of the blow-off top target and fakeout target during the last week, took decent profit, and now playing the trap and will add to shorts in small size at key upside levels (mostly spreads to mitigate the cost). Hedges (VIX) are still cheap. The range, I laid down in the weekly post is crucial, bcs out of the range upwards, the market bets on a squeeze-up towards 25s.This is a day-by-day week for both swing traders and daytraders… SubscribeLet’s look at today’s positioning… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
