Market analysisJanuary OpEx week quant breakdown | Weekly post (12-16/Jan) - FREEJan 11, 2026182ShareLast weekly post upside target was hit. I kept warning to not be bearish on SCOTUS as nothing will happen, Trump has a plan B, that I broke down publicly in details. I expected optimism and constructive datas for the week with profit taking into Thursday and optimism back into Friday. It all happened…Uncertainity and fear is growing. Mostly due to global risks and supply-chain issues from China. I warned you about it last year and before. A lot of stress will accumulate into spring. Things will start then…I published a very important article in which I describe the nature of the approaching crisis, the characteristics of the AI/tech bubble and the warning signs of its impending burst, along with a few key timing considerations and hedging ideas—placing all of this in the context of a globally shifting geopolitical and world‑economic landscape. This bubble has been building for more than six years, and its groundwork was laid eleven years ago (the post also contains Bitcoin, oil, TSM, NVDA, yields): Market analysisThe challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significant—yet still underpriced—risk in the market.Read full story(I added new sections to it)Please read the article carefully. I like short vol trades on the front-end but scaling into long straddles on the long-end. Also I like deep OTP TLT puts, and quarterly put flies to hedge the equity upside momentum trades. For now, the dice keep rolling and ppl still keep betting on the numbers even tho they know the dice are loaded and the game is rigged. Pain trade is up like a vaccum. First serious shake can be expected in Q2 (as I keep saying this since last summer). Until both side will be exhausted: bulls will not get enough momentum, bears will be lured in and humiliated by a rangebound with a net positive drift. Rotation at max. SubscribeLet’s analyse the next weekly sentiment and bets… WEEKLY POST (OPEX)Let’s look at the january OpEx positioning: The speed profile is net negative, customers are selling realized volatility into both ways, but 1.27x more vol is sold to the downside than to the upside. So they expect more momentum up but not a squeeze, while betting on downside premium decay.The centroid of the profile, where the impact is balanced is at 6902.91 zone (with margin of error of 6859.01 if vol catches up). The profile favors for a wide rangebound with a net positive drift while downside is protected, I will scrutinize the bet and sentiment further. Let’s see the spine of the positioning:Downside pivot is at 6835.10target is 6793.01 (the most supportive cluster)Upside pivot is at 7016.02with target of 7070.29 (stabilization is only above the pivot, target is magnetic is vol declines above the pivot).Let’s look closer at the dealer exposure to decode the expectations… MM exposureThe profile is net short delta with long charm. That is almost hand in hand with a net negative speed profile.Net long gamma means the base case is short realized volatility, butNet short color pushes gamma negative into Thursday, so does the speed profile, also shifting the supportive cluster up towards the downside pivot. Net zomma is also positive lowering the IV/RV correlation. Until Wednesday, there is more upside zomma, providing a heavy protection against tail event, but after Wednesday it shifts, even a -5% IV suppression pushes the net gamma into negative territory. This is a trappy environment for both sides. Net vega is positive, meaning the base bet is short vol from the customer side, butNet veta is negative, pushing net vega down to negative into Thursday. Net vomma is positive with a very high exposure, with more ultima on downside vol. As I coded, even a 3-5% vol suppression shifts net vega into negative territory. So the path of the least resistance is upward for IV. Net vanna is negative (flip at 6800) and very heavy exposure especially to the downside, even on Friday. This is like having a short ratio call spread to the upside and a short ratio put spread to the downside with 1.3x more vol being sold to the downside from the customer side with a net bet of short vol long delta bet. Also, below you will see that skew is bid, and customers are net selling the skew, but this trade concentrates on assuming overpriced downside rather than any upside squeeze. By zomma, they express this mispricing, because it says that downside vanna grows after Wednesday, meaning the short skew trade is even heavier on the left-side of the smirk. However, the positioning also warns us that market expects risk into Thursday-Friday window, if vol declines too much (by ~3-5%) they will see it as complacency! They expect IV to rangebound with a flat-to-positive drift. Vomma projected rangeDeriving the expected volatility changes and projecting the spot movements it can cause, my calculation provide Downside zone of 6853.06 - 6889.41 Upside zone of 7011.15 - 7032.36 where the vol move can take the spot and it shifts to supportive from below and supportive above. This also means that market expects a reversion from the downside in the worst case, while doesn’t expect upside stabilization either, but the net drift of the trend points up, through rangebound. Fix strike skew is increased by 46.79% at the tails due to tail hedges growing, while 22-delta skew increased by 46.53% mostly due to OTM call selling, while the whole smirk is down by net 4.04%  I think, that for now this is only a noise, as most of the tail skew bid is a result of spot up, and the previous 30-20 delta long puts slided below 10-deltas, and this is exactly what the market is shorting. SubscribeSentimentDeriving the sentiment, it tells me that market expects: the week to open hectic in order to provide room for short vol trades and upside moves, so the sentiment will converge towards moderate risk-taking, the short vol trade is confident;CPI release is expected to trap long vol traders (no direction bias), while optimistic stabilisation coming later on (so market will calm down later and remains optimistic), bad news are still good news and vice versa;For PPI release, Mr. Market expects short vol trades and optimism to peak, they don’t fear PPI, supportive narrative is already prepared for both cases;For Thursday, the optimism remains but  traders are expected to start to take profit from their short vol/short skew trades, and the momentum cools down (not necessary reversion, but more vulnerable downside and end of the initial momentum);On Friday the mood is expected to be more serious and pragmatic opposite to the initial purely speculative vol trades, consolidation and risk-off is expected, but nothing bearishness, only a shift back from speculation into the basic protective stance, end of the weekly cycle.
