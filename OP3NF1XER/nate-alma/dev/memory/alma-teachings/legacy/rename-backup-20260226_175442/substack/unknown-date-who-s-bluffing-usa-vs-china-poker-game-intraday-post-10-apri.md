USA vs. China poker game + Intraday post (10/April)Digging into the April 9 eventsApr 10, 2025∙ Paid2622ShareHere comes the continuation of yesterday’s post…I’ll explain what the title refers to. If you’re playing poker against a strong opponent and the stakes keep rising relentlessly, and you’re no longer sure how to read your opponent’s reactions—how far they’re willing to go—you might pull off a double feint, which means pretending temporal weakness and watching how your opponent responds. If they also reduce the pressure, there’s a pretty good chance they’re just bluffing.However, we’re observing the game from the outside, trying to figure out which player to bet on. Because right now, we’re speculators, not investors. The question, then, is: who’s bluffing: US or China?I’m going to explore that topic now, in light of yesterday’s ~10% run-up.The April 9 twistTrump’s April 9 tariff policy twist – elevating tariffs on China (especially consumer goods) while delaying or reducing tariffs on other countries – was a deliberate strategic pivot. To understand its implications, we should break down the policy and economic logic.By 2025, China was by far the largest source of U.S. consumer product imports (everything from electronics to apparel to appliances). In prior tariff rounds (2018–2019), the Trump administration had often exempted many consumer goods or imposed lower rates, partly to avoid direct pain on U.S. consumers. This time, Trump went all-in, slapping tariffs that reportedly exceeded 100% on a broad swath of Chinese exports. The rationale seemed to be punitive – to pressure China intensely – but it also means U.S. importers and consumers will face sharp price increases on everyday goods. By contrast, tariffs on key allies (Europe, Canada, Japan, etc.) were paused at 10% or avoided entirely for 90 days, giving those countries a chance to negotiate or adjust supply chains.Trump’s likely calculation was that he could afford to anger China but did not want to completely alienate U.S. allies and U.S. businesses all at once. It’s a divide-and-conquer approach in the trade war. Crucial.Tariffs on consumer goods are generally inflationary in the short run – they act as a sales tax on imports, raising prices for U.S. buyers. For example, Federal Reserve economists have estimated that a broad 10% tariff on imports could lift core CPI inflation by a few tenths of a percent over the course of a year. In this case, with over $500 billion of Chinese goods facing tariffs potentially above 50-100%, U.S. consumer price indices will see upward pressure as those costs filter through. Indeed, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler noted in early April that some of the recent rise in goods inflation was “anticipatory” of the tariffs’ effect, as businesses and consumers rushed to buy items (like cars and appliances) before higher prices hit.However, while tariffs can create price spikes, they also weaken demand, which can be deflationary down the line. Consumers confronted with significantly higher prices may cut back spending or switch to cheaper alternatives. If real incomes don’t keep up, overall consumption falls. Businesses, seeing higher input costs and potentially lower sales volumes, might reduce investment or hiring. In the broader sense, tariffs act like a tax increase on the economy – sucking purchasing power and potentially leading to demand destruction. Yesterday I wrote that Powell articulated this dilemma: trade tariffs simultaneously slow growth and raise inflation in the short term. The Fed and others feared a stagflationary hit, where the Fed’s usual policy response is complicated (easing helps growth but could stoke inflation, whereas tightening would curb inflation but deepen the slowdown). If policy errs on the side of tightness (to fight tariff-driven inflation), a deeper slump and even deflationary spiral could result once the one-off price boosts fade. By delaying or lowering tariffs on U.S. allies, Trump likely hoped to ease global opposition and cushion the impact on supply chains. Europe, for instance, was given a 90-day reprieve, which European officials welcomed as “good news” enabling further talks. This means supply routes from Europe, Latin America, and other partners could temporarily substitute for some Chinese imports (where feasible) without incurring tariffs – an intentional pressure tactic against Beijing.However, if companies shift sourcing to avoid Chinese tariffs, it could be less efficient or more costly, still raising prices somewhat. Moreover, this selective approach could distort trade flows: countries not subject to the tariff (say Vietnam or Mexico) might see a surge in demand for their goods, potentially causing bottlenecks or higher prices there. In effect, while the tariff delay for others helps avoid a synchronized price shock on all imports, it doesn’t fully eliminate inflationary pressure – it merely concentrates it on China-exposed supply chains. It also means China bears the brunt of the economic hit among U.S. trade partners, which was precisely Trump’s intent.By sharply raising import costs on consumer goods, the tariffs could indeed reduce real consumer spending – households might delay purchases or downtrade to cheaper goods, slowing economic activity. If businesses can’t pass on all costs, some may cut margins or lay off workers, adding slack to the labor market. Already, by March 2025 there were signs of disinflation: the Fed noted that progress toward its 2% inflation target had stalled and that underlying inflation measures were not falling. If the trade war induces a recession, the likely trajectory would be an initial bump in inflation (from tariffs) followed by a downturn where demand collapses and prices start to fall. We can look at China as a cautionary example: China entered deflation this year partly because exports weakened amid trade tensions. In March, China’s CPI was down 0.1% year-on-year (a second monthly decline) and producer prices were down 2.5%, with analysts explicitly citing the escalating U.S. trade war and unsold exports as factors driving Chinese prices lower. In effect, China is exporting deflation – its excess supply and lower-cost goods, facing tariffs, either pile up domestically (forcing price cuts) or get diverted globally, pushing prices down elsewhere. For the U.S., tariffs on consumer goods from China mean Americans pay more at the store, unless Chinese firms cut their prices to retain market share.There is some evidence Chinese exporters may have to absorb part of the tariff by lowering prices (to remain competitive), which ironically reinforces deflationary pressure in China and globally. If Chinese firms slash prices by, say, 20% to offset a 100% tariff, U.S. consumers see a 80% net price rise on those goods, but Chinese profit margins collapse – leading potentially to factory layoffs and further deflation in China. That, in turn, can spill back to the U.S. through cheaper intermediate goods or a weaker Chinese yuan.If Trump intended the dramatic tariff announcement followed by a quick partial retreat as a grand bluff to rattle China but then reassure Wall Street, it partially succeeded – he demonstrated he was “crazy enough” to go nuclear on tariffs, but also that he would blink if markets melted down too far. This could strengthen his hand diplomatically (showing China that the U.S. has emergency mechanisms to buffer its markets, so China shouldn’t assume the U.S. will cave easily). However, it’s a dangerous game: relying on the Fed and markets to cushion self-inflicted shocks undermine long-term confidence from the Middle-East’s and Russia’s part. When the world’s safest asset (U.S. Treasuries) suddenly behaves unpredictably, it rattles global trust. If big holders like Saudi Arabia’s SAMA, UAE’s ADIA, or Russia’s sovereign fund see wild swings and the prospect of U.S. policy driving down the value of their holdings, they may reconsider allocations.China US debt sellingIf China were to retaliate by aggressively selling U.S. Treasuries and ramping up tariffs, the near-term effect would be sharply higher U.S. interest rates, severe stress in financial markets, and a further collapse in bilateral trade. Also Europe’s economy, already stagnating, could tip into deep recession as global trade falls and financial uncertainty spikes.Even the fear of Chinese selling itself is enough to move the market: recall that in early April, “markets [were] concerned that China and other countries could ‘dump’ U.S. Treasuries as a retaliation tool. Hence, UST yields [went] up.” We saw yields leap to multi-year highs partly on this concern. If actual dumping occurred, a disorderly surge in yields could result. For example, the 10-year yield could shoot well above 5% or 6% in short order if there’s no intervention. Such a spike raises borrowing costs across the board – mortgages, car loans, business loans, and government debt – tightening financial conditions dramatically.Highly leveraged funds would face margin calls as bond prices fell, potentially causing some to fail. The U.S. government itself would face sharply higher interest costs; if sustained, this would balloon the federal deficit due to higher debt service, creating a vicious cycle of more borrowing and further upward pressure on yields. In extreme scenarios, this can lead to a self-reinforcing selloff or even questions about U.S. debt sustainability as investors lose confidence. While the U.S. could ultimately rely on the Fed to buy its debt (more on that soon), the interim volatility would be severe.The Federal Reserve’s likely reaction to a massive foreign selloff would be to intervene as a buyer of last resort. This means launching a new round of quantitative easing, explicitly purchasing Treasuries to absorb the supply China (and potentially others) dump. In effect, the Fed would be monetizing the debt to keep yields from spiraling upward. The Fed could also cut interest rates (if not already at zero) to offset tightening. However, these actions have consequences: rapidly expanding the Fed’s balance sheet to counteract a foreign selloff might undermine confidence in the dollar or future inflation. It could be seen as the Fed accommodating fiscal needs (debt financing), potentially denting its inflation-fighting credibility. Yet, not acting is likely worse – if yields spiked uncontrollably, the U.S. economy would crash. So the Fed would almost surely step in, as Bank of England did in 2022 when UK bond yields surged. The question is whether the Fed could buy fast enough to stabilize the market and whether doing so would introduce longer-term inflation risk. This essentially becomes a contest between China’s selling and the Fed’s buying. The Fed, with infinite printing power, can in theory always win, but at the possible cost of devaluing the currency.However…Selling Treasuries would also impact China’s economy. If it causes the yuan to rise (because selling USD assets tends to push USD down vs yuan), Chinese exports become less competitive at a time they are already hampered by tariffs. China’s central bank could counter by easing monetary policy – cutting interest rates or reserve requirements to stimulate domestic demand – trying to offset export losses with internal growth. They could also impose stricter capital controls to prevent their own firms from taking money out during the turmoil. Additionally, China could accelerate trade with other partners (the EU, ASEAN) to make up for lost U.S. business, although global recession would make that hard. If the confrontation is that severe, China might accept a couple of years of very slow growth or recession as a cost of standing up to the U.S., just as the U.S. would be enduring a recession too. Essentially, it’d be a test of whose system can absorb more pain.(Chinese authorities have more direct control over their economy (state banks, state-owned enterprises, etc.) and could probably maintain stability (e.g., forbid layoffs or use fiscal firepower to keep things running) for some time even in a downturn. Politically, they would cast it as resisting U.S. aggression, which might rally nationalist support despite economic hardship.)The April 9 SpikeBRICS and Middle-East resources say that the dramatic intraday rebound did not represent a healthy rebalancing but rather a “circuit breaker” response engineered by the Fed. They note that while the U.S. ultimately averted a collapse, the market reaction exposed vulnerabilities that could be exploited if shocks recur. Although they emphasize that the U.S. remains fundamentally strong, they have concern over the frequency and intensity of such emergency actions.Beijing increased tariffs selectively and focused on sectors where the impact would signal resolve without triggering runaway instability. The PBOC implemented liquidity‑support measures such as lowering reserve requirement ratios and guiding state‑owned banks to extend credit in vulnerable export regions. Beijing saw the U.S. episode as a temporary volatility event rather than systemic failure. Chinese experts evaluated the situation and concluded that the Fed’s intervention was a necessary adjustment rather than a reflection of deep structural weakness.The EU and many BRICS members expressed concern over the vulnerabilities exposed by the U.S. crisis. They are re‑evaluating their reliance on the U.S. financial system, with some calling for a more multipolar arrangement in global finance.Trump is seemed as impulsive and hysterical while Xi’s reaction, by contrast, was measured.So, while the Fed’s actions certainly helped to calm the bond market and provided necessary liquidity, they did not amount to a full-blown “monetary easing” package like a rate cut or aggressive quantitative easing program. U.S. policymakers appeared to view the April 9 volatility as a technical market disruption that could be managed with these focused measures.In contrast, Chinese authorities implemented more explicit liquidity‑providing measures. These included lowering the reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) and guiding state‑owned banks to expand credit in export‑sensitive sectors. Such measures are textbook examples of monetary easing aimed at supporting domestic demand and stabilizing financial conditions. These moves aim to offset external shocks (like U.S. tariffs and global market volatility) and support domestic demand.However…Trump’s strategy marked by (steep tariffs on Chinese imports) directly increases the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S. market. This can hurt export-oriented sectors of the Chinese economy, reducing profits and potentially curbing further investment. When China is relying on monetary easing to stimulate domestic activity, a significant hit to its export revenues can undermine its overall policy effectiveness. Furthermore, aggressive U.S. trade policy may force Chinese companies to accelerate diversification of their supply chains away from the U.S., thereby shortening the window during which monetary easing can generate growth.During periods of global economic retrenchment, countries that excessively eased monetarily without corresponding improvements in trade balances faced capital flight and depreciation pressures. Trump's policies, by intensifying trade friction, may create an environment where China’s easing is insufficient to sustain growth, forcing further aggressive policy measures that could eventually destabilize its financial markets. This would diminish investors’ confidence in China, and would force China into an even tighter policy corner—possibly exposing vulnerabilities that it hoped to offset through easing alone.The question is whether Trump dares to take further aggressive steps against his opponent. As mentioned yesterday, the risk/reward doesn't favor him.Back to the initial ideaBut let’s not forget something I’ve been saying since March:The goal remains a U.S.–Russia agreement, which also requires the participation of the globalist elite. The tariffs and all other measures aim, on one hand, to bring the globalist elite to the negotiating table with the U.S. On the other hand, Trump needs to eradicate stagflation from the American economy, which can only be done with drastic steps—and that requires genuine deflationary fear. This is a dangerous game because, on one hand, foreign investors lose confidence; on the other, the EU is finding new sources for itself with China.That’s why Trump, using the double feint we discussed above, is trying to block China, and—if I’m correct—it seems the bluff is working.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
