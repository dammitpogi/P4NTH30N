The positioning breakdown below will be telling what the market expects. Nvidia beat the expectations, but concerns are still there that the spending is unsustainable, but this is a long-term concern not an immediate one. The fact that “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out” should be supportive for now.I cautiously think the Window of Risk is coming to an end now. First we got a 265.85 pts decline, then a 344.55 pts decline with higher lows. I want to see how market digests the news, plus we have OpEx and hedge unwind. I want to see how the market positions shift.SubscribeI tell you why…The Nvida ER gave another fresh push to the AI bubble for now. And NFP is delayed again. This makes both the Fed and the market completely blindfolded, and also results in less macro-based trends and more micro-based mechanical movements, literal simulations. So with this step, admin solved the problem on the short-run to throw the macro effects out of the window. Breadth is very bearish, but this market is being built on AI narrative now, and the expectation is that automatic contributions, model portfolios and ETF rebalancing, market maker hedging flows keep pushing flows; and intraday trading is largely systematic anyway. Also SOFR is ~0.37 percentage points lower than the Oct 28 peak, it s still trading a bit above fed funds (~+6 bps on Nov 18), but the gap is smaller than the ~+15 bps around Oct 31. So, Short-term funding stress is easing, but system liquidity is still vulnerable. Not a green light, only a yellow one after red alert. We can assume that “top is in” for SOFR.So, the EOY rally will be driven on these, that I strongly think will come. Also I mentioned in the most recent free post linked above, that as long as the SPX doesn’t show strenght in the 6791.68 - 6845.46 area, the pressure remains to the downside, reaching the downside target of my WoR.So be careful. I’m cautiously bullish, but market is not out of the woods yet, on the near-term!On the crypto front…We will see if BTC gives us the rebound, I think it would along with the market.I don’t buy BTC until it reaches my target, but then too I will be aware of some liquidity grab to 30-40k area.As you know, I never all-in on one position.SubscribeLet’s scrutinize the daily positioning… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
