A year is over...Dec 31, 20252842ShareWell, eleven months have passed since I launched my Substack blog—after, in 2024, you had been asking me for more than half a year to create a private place where I could share my analyses. And I’ll be completely honest: I didn’t think it would be this successful. At the beginning, I expected maybe 20–30 people would subscribe; today, however, I’m at 2,494 subscribers.Both the community and I have been through important trials—and a kind of purification. From the community, those have fallen away who were only looking for a free lunch, as well as people coming from other businesses who merely wanted to copy my code and sell it within their own service, and who tried to demoralize the community with fabricated accusations.And so what remained is a wonderful, diverse community—full of both highly experienced and less experienced people: market makers, fund managers, and retail traders—united by curiosity, a spirit of exploration, and, most importantly, the humility all of this requires.This is a community that, by multiple testimonials, is inspiring; it excludes no one and insults no one. Some have started university studies because of it; others were finally able to leave their 8-hour-a-day job. I’ve received countless thank-you messages.Thank you so much. I’m truly grateful to every one of you, and I’ll keep doing my best to provide analyses worthy of you.  SubscribeSome snippets from everyday chat…Substack has challenged me in several ways, too. I had to learn how to tailor my thoughts and analyses as optimally as possible to the needs of roughly two thousand subscribers, and to communicate them clearly and in a structured way.That took time on my part—and patience on your part—since I’m inexperienced when it comes to services like this. But I think we’re on the right track. Thank you to those of you who believed in me.We called the February top; we called the geopolitical shifts—much of which is already included in the official presidential NSS report; we called the March bull trap, the April crash and the bottom, as well as the window-of-risk intervals.This market isn’t easy. It’s full of manipulation and fraud, and it contains many non-trivial risks that matter for investors and for people who think in one-year horizons.Many of you have been constantly asking me not to stop after a year. In fact, at the beginning I was planning for 1–1.5 years, because of my other commitments.This isn’t my full-time job—and it won’t be. I’ve also begun studies in national security, so my time is limited.However, as I’ve already told many of you, I’ll say it here as well: for the foreseeable future—through August—I can continue providing the service in the usual format. From September onward, we’ll see. Several of you have said you’d be willing to subscribe even if it were only for weekly analyses. Ultimately my time will decide, but that is workable.It will depend on external circumstances when I switch to weekly-only analyses, because I don’t want to overcommit myself. But I will let you know in good time.Next year I will implement the one-time subscription fee increase I promised, to €50, and after that there will be no further increases. Naturally, this affects only new subscribers (just like the switch to pricing in euros).SubscribeAnd now I wish every one of you a happy, successful, and productive new year—with this beautiful piece of music. And don’t forget the old saying: as you sow, so shall you reap! :)~AP.S.: Here you can find some of the testimonials from the subscribers…  From Alma’s subscriber chatAlmaYOUR TESTIMONIALS25 repliesStochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

- Text: Terrence Chan Jan 3Liked by AlmaLove the self reflection and comments about how you have learned and grown and evolved how you communicate and structure your analysis. I have seen it evolve over time and agree that the areas of focus have tightened up. Also you’ve broken out your creative thinking and hypotheses on the impact of geo-politics (which have led to some amazing predictions) from your mathematical approach to identifying weekly and intraday market positioning impacts on price movements and volatility. What makes you unique in the industry IMHO is your ability to do both - think “outside the box” and also inside the box with mathematics and position analysis. My only ask and maybe suggestion for the point you decide to pivot your service when time becomes less available for you, is to “be like water” and deal with it in a fluid manner - the ebbs and flows of what is going on in markets and in the world no doubt will continue to be chaotic - and you never know what variables in yours and our lives will change in 8-12 months. A new service maybe becomes apparent for you to offer us that delivers even more value than what you have already come up with - cheers to you and all of us in the new year!Like (1)ReplyShare
