Market analysisIntraday post (22/April)Apr 22, 2025∙ Paid112ShareWeekly post is here, very important… as always…Investor confidence continues to weaken, and further capital is being withdrawn.At the heart of that distrust lies the belief that China holds a stronger hand than the U.S., and since America’s risk/reward profile is less favorable, investors expect the U.S. to fold before China—despite its significantly stronger economy and military.China has thrown down the gauntlet and keeps sending the world that message.And that is a question no one can answer—not even the intelligence agencies—because no one can see both sides’ cards, exact reserves, and psychological strengths in their entirety.In any case, money is still flowing out of the U.S. economy.U.S. equity ETFs saw $10.62 billion of net outflows in the week to April 16, reflecting broad risk‑off sentiment. Foreign investors alone dumped $6.5 billion of U.S. equities over the five trading sessions ending April 10U.S. bond funds suffered $10.07 billion of outflows in the week to April 16, while global bond funds lost $19.96 billion, marking their worst week since 2020, n the prior week to April 9, U.S. bond funds posted their largest weekly outflows since December 2022 at $15.64 billion.U.S. short‑term government bond funds (T‑bill ETFs) attracted $7.1 billion in the week to April 16, as investors parked cash in ultra‑safe paper and global money‑market funds saw $122.96 billion of net withdrawals in that same period. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index slumped to 97.923 on April 21—its weakest since March 2022—as investors balk at U.S. political and trade‑policy risks.U.S. two‑year swap spreads briefly inverted to –46 bp, their tightest since November 2024, signalling acute stress in the interbank market.Swap‑line usage is ver low, indicating no active dollar‑liquidity support via foreign central banks. The Fed’s Overnight Reverse‑Repo (RRP) facility still absorbs about $114.114 billion of cash daily (April 21, 2025) as money‑market funds and other counterparties park excess liquidity. Award rate remains at 4.25%Fed is effectively “sterilizing” treasury supply and keeping its balance sheet runoff on autopilot. When foreign investors sell U.S. Treasuries, the dollars they receive often flow into money‑market vehicles, which in turn park those funds in the RRP facility—so in that sense, the Fed “absorbs” the cash freed up by Treasury sales. Elevated RRP balances therefore signal that cash is being withdrawn from private lending markets (and indirectly from Treasury holdings) and parked at the Fed instead.Also the Standing Repo Facility remain operational, and discount‑window drawdowns are minimal—no sign of expanded backstops yet. Repo purchases are low.Meanwhile, Europe is preparing for easing. Please understand the poker game at work here—that is the key. I have laid it out.
