Market analysisFed, QE, Bulltrap? + Intraday post (30/April) Apr 30, 2025∙ Paid1913ShareHere is the big landscape and weekly post again…And chinese plane landed in Beirut. This post is playing out…Derivatives markets now price in a 44–50% chance of a rate cut at the next June FOMC. Traders expect rapid‐fire cuts if JOLTS and CPI disappoints. Job openings fell by 288,000 in March 2025—the steepest drop since 2021—dropping to 7.192 million. This single datum sent markets scrambling to price in softer NFP and higher recession odds. U.S. import volumes from China plunged 36–43%, and booking cancellations hit more than 50% on key lanes. ‘Empty shelves’If inventories run out → sales disappointments → layoffs begin: continuing claims jumped 41,000 to 1.885 million.So we can expect a broad economic pullback. Our beloved Bessent publicly lean into the rhetoric of “strategic uncertainty,” signaling to markets that a downturn (and thus rate cuts) is desirable, plus IMF, JPM, Fed governors, and Trump himself create a chorus of easing demands. This sequence is magnified by the bullwhip effect.Now, listen…The May 2 de minimis tariff change and April 9 steep tariffs both landed just before key data releases, amplifying their impactPowell has stressed that rate cuts are not on a preset path and depend on clear evidence of slack.So the string of weakening data is not purely coincidental but rather part of a coordinated effort (by policymakers, fiscal authorities) to generate enough economic stress to justify Federal Reserve rate cuts. A sharp JOLTS collapse signals cooling NFP, which feeds into a freight‐volumes slump, leading to empty shelves within weeks, and ultimately rising joblessness. Each step reflects how weakening labor demand ripples through goods movement and inventory, then back into hiring, completing a negative feedback loop.Be careful…If they really pull off that rate cut in June, we’ll likely see a modest bull run—much like last October’s—provided, as I’ve said, that GDP and NFP data align. That said, inflationary pressures will reemerge by mid-summer. And while QE could stave off a deflationary spiral in the short term, it isn’t sustainable—stagflation today runs deeper than before. Best to sit back and let the events unfold.
