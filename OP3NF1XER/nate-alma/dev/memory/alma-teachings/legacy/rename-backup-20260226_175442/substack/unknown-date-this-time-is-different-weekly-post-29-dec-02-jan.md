Market analysis"This time is different" | Weekly post (29/Dec - 02/Jan)Dec 28, 2025∙ Paid1912ShareI hope, everyone of you is well and had a really good and rich time with their beloved ones… Last week, Trump posted about inflation and good vs bad news. I relink my intraday post where I reacted to it in details. Please, read it before continue…What Trump said doesn’t mean that market will never go down again. It means that they will do everything to push it higher, and I think, it will happen before the bubble bursts.Spring is a risk, and January FOMC too. As I keep saying, market became heavily manipulated, and so I don’t see edge playing short-side. I’m net long, I hedge volatility only, and use the dips to buy into the bubble. Short sellers must be humiliated before market forms a dip, thats how old school big guys operate…This week we have FOMC Minutes on Tuesday 14.00PM ET;Half-day on Dec 31;Market is closed on ThursdayOkay, soThe GDP itself is very suspicious for the markets and inflation concerns emerged. Market started to reprice the easing cycle expectations, still the market went upward over the last week.The reason for that was the daily iron condors with heavily big sizes. At this level on such a low volume environment, it operates as an elevator that lifts up everything that is inside it, no matter what. These intraday positions completely counterbalanced the weekly bets of the market and forced those positions to be sold creating more mechanical upward pressure. In the weekly post I market, that the more the market goes farther from the centroid the more vol suppression we can expect, and market is expected to stabilize above 6915.75, with magnet of 6928.60; and that more vol was sold to the upside. We left a very low realized vol behind thanks to the ICs, but market will retest if the sentiment has actually followed the volatility or not. I see, the tension. And that tension will hit back.Ironically, this aggressively manipulated short vol trade created a rather fragile environment than stable. But I will scrutinize it below…Structurally the tape shows upside vacuum towards 7010/15 zone, while on Monday open, the market left a gap. This gap doesn’t really have magnetic effect as it was filled with liquidity before, so it should be supportive.We will scrutinize, what the market thinks about it. The problem that the market sees is that short vol and long spot trade is overcrowded, while it accumulated serious vol of vol and zomma risk (as you will see below). Realized volatility is currently at 9.37%, that is like ~4 pts below my target. This is not a multi year low, I even saw 4-5% RV during Trump’s first admin in Oct of 2017 before a ~10% squeeze up, before market finally corrected back 10%. We will see, but when vol of vol is grinding upward and the trade is crowded, then the whole structure becomes very fragile and sensitive to even a small increase in vol. And now, I don’t see IC for the next week… SubscribeSo, stay awake, but the gap should be very supportive, and does not need to be filled. Let’s look at the positioning, how the market sees this structure, and what levels it bets on… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
