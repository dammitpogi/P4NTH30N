April's performance reviewFor all Subscribers...May 14, 2025318ShareDear Subscribers,Recently I received some criticism about the macro content from last April. I admit this topic is very complex and hard to understand, but let’s not forget: the primary purpose of this Substack is to teach tape analysis, and macro processes are a key part of that game.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

Once that ‘weighing machine’ has been turned on, it has restructured the market and set it on a new path. To monitor and interpret news, data, and policy shifts in the future, you need to understand the story behind the curtain that volatility cycles are telling. Not to mention that in such a high-volatility environment—when we’re literally in the tails, as we saw over the past few weeks—usual mechanical and structural flows simply don’t work. Instead, I explained the dynamics that did matter.The events will show up on the tape one way or another, but to understand why the market reacts in a certain, seemingly irrational way, you’ve got to grasp the real meaning behind those events. If you remember Trump’s speeches back in February and March—and the market’s unpredictable swings—you know exactly what I mean. I’ve basically decoded all of that for you, and my goal was to walk you through how I arrived at those conclusions.The market is ultimately about valuing things at its core. If you grasp this, you’ll see that volatility cycles always need to have a narrative—otherwise they’re neither manageable nor sustainable. That’s why the story matters.(And I’m glad I didn’t launch the Substack during a dull bull-market rally, but in a year when the global economic landscape is literally being repolarized.)A good analyst needs to be able to switch between approaches and pinpoint the key driver behind volatility cycles. I recognized in time that it was the macro and geo environment and front-ran the events effectively. Now that the weighing machine has reset the market regime—forcing it onto a new path—and the volatility market has adapted accordingly, we can return to microstructures, because the story is finally unfolding and the context is taking shape. This is how cycles work. One day you’ll get it.This may seem strange way of approach, but it produced results. And please allow me to analyze things the way I think they should be analyzed!  Since many people got lost in the information, I made a quick review of April’s performance in terms of momentum. I also posted this on Twitter—here you can see it:“Was it perfect? -Not at all. But at least, it was real” Somebody also sent me a PDF. He scanned all my posts since March, checked for consistencies and inconsistencies, and compared my posts to the actual realized events. He/they estimated my April hit rate around 91%, and my trade signals hit rate around 80-82%… in a historically high vol environment…Here you can read it. I think it is a good summary and review. Please don’t criticize me without truly reviewing what I actually wrote.Thank you for your understanding and support.I remain your quant,~AStochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.
