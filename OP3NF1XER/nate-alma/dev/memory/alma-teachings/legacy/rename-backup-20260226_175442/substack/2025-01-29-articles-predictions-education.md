Thank you for your continued attention and support. My (self-)reflection of the passed year can be read here. (Thank you for the nice comments and private mails) At the beginning of January, I published a very important article in which I describe the nature of the approaching crisis, the characteristics of the AI/tech bubble and the warning signs of its impending burst, along with a few key timing considerations and hedging ideas—placing all of this in the context of a globally shifting geopolitical and world‑economic landscape. This bubble has been building for more than six years, and its groundwork was laid eleven years ago.

Please read the article and share it. SubscribeIn recent weeks, I also posted another educational piece focused on the concept of liquidity, and I use that context to present the gamma‑derivative speed profile framework I use for intraday trading. Educational postsLiquidity structure | Let's put speed profile into contextAlma·Jan 7During the 2021 GameStop gamma squeeze, the retail crowd discovered the options market and the hedging activity of market makers. The newly discovered “low – the idea that options positioning can directly impact the price of the underlying asset – went through multiple, almost conspiratorial misinterpretations. On the back of this, a lot of furus jumped into building gamma/delta etc. data-providing services, operating on the old “sell shovels during a gold rush” principle.Read full storyThis article follows my earlier trading‑focused educational posts, where I introduced the fundamentals of intraday trading My basic trading principles Pt. 1 - Strategies, basic risk managementAlma·July 2, 2025Read full storythen explained the mathematical pitfalls ("the “Casino”) and what the true path to long‑term growth and wealth building looks like (through my own personal example) My trading principles Pt. 2 - The Wall Street Casino and My StoryAlma·September 20, 2025Read full storyprovided a guide to my intraday posts A Guide to Reading My Daily PostsAlma·November 11, 2025Read full storyintroduced the short realized volatility strategy Statistical-arbitrage: Mean Reversion TradingAlma·October 24, 2025Read full storyand explained the meaning and operating principle of the sentiment proxy I use for market analysis The "Bessent put" - SPX/yields correlation; (Hidden QE)Alma·December 19, 2025Read full storyNext, I will place the options Greeks into this same framework, and I will continue to develop my work on momentum trading.

- Text: Molly Jan 11EditedDear Alma, I like to read you but on you X profile you said you don’t plan to write substack for more than a year and that we should purschase only monthly subscriptions. That claim seems to be valid for one more month since you’d announced it on Feb 1 2025. Now I read in this article that the price of subs are going up and yearly subscription still available. So, which is true and how long do you plan to write and publish here? Thank you in advance for your reply!LikeReplyShare
