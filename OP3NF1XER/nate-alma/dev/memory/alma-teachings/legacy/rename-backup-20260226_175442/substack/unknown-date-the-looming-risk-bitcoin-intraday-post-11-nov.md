Market analysisThe looming risk, Bitcoin - Intraday post (11/Nov)AI, SCOTUS, BTC, Trump, China, tariffs, Iran - Uncertainity after uncertainityNov 11, 2025∙ Paid121ShareUpdated window of risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Alma·October 29, 2025Read full storyWeekly post: Geo and policy uncertainity is here - Weekly post (10-14/Nov)Alma·November 9, 2025Read full storyPlease take a look at this quoted tweet: Let’s look at it closer: 1) CoreWeave beat Q3 revenue but trimmed 2025 guidance because a third-party data-center delay pushes deliveries/revenue to the right. Even with big top-line growth, profitability is getting pressured—higher accelerator costs, financing/interest expense, and the risk that depreciation overwhelms margins if revenue ramps slip. Banks have been warning that depreciation on massive AI capex (GPUs/servers) is underappreciated and will hit earnings as assets age faster than accounting lives. Barclays flagged this as a top risk for hyperscalers heading into 2025–26.2) Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank sold its entire Nvidia stake (~$5.8B) while pivoting capital toward other AI bets (OpenAI/“Stargate,” Arm, etc.). Smart-money de-risking into peak euphoria.3) I’m focused on the Supreme Court case testing the administration’s use of emergency powers for broad tariffs. If admin loses, it would force a re-architecture of tariff policy through 2026, with messy refund litigation over previously collected tariffs and a scramble to design narrower, statute-clean trade tools. If the market has to re-price trade/inflation/earnings and a chaotic D.C. tape at once, we could see another April-type of crash. (Next year potentially)4) Treasury’s own trackers show gross federal debt ≈ $38T in late Oct/early Nov. Also interest costs now surpass defense. CBO/IMF see big deficits and rising debt, close to 6–6½% of GDP, while BRICS is moving away from US treasuries. Market remains very headline sensitive as stated in the weekly post.Uncertainity is very high. Headlines are unpredictable. TACO doesn’t save everything. A bigger market repricing is most likely in the window right after the US government reopens, when a backlog of official data finally hits (jobs, inflation, retail sales, etc.). That rush of information would land before the next FOMC meeting (Dec 9-10), forcing investors to quickly reset rate/path expectations. With missing data, officials are split on how soft the labor market/inflation really are; reporting has emphasized a “thickening data fog” and a highly divided FOMC. I strongly think that the Fed’s next move will look like a small cut with hawkish language, with a very split decision. SubscribeI see rebound around December, but I don’t see correction is over.I took profit, and keep selling strenght.Also some of my intels hinted that Israel-Hamas and even Iran conflicts are not over. Market doesn’t really price in any of these risks.BitcoinHere is the chart: BTC broke the structure I marked in my July 23 post (“Playing the AI bubble”).I mark 112-115k as the range it should reconquer to prove further uptrend. Datas don’t look too good now. I’m patient with BTC, waiting for my buying target to play out. Not speculating. I’m not a buyer here. Digitalization of the stockmarket is going on. Cryptomarket will become stockmarket, see “Vision2031”, UAE is deliberately building the rails to integrate digital assets with capital markets (Web3)—via tokenization rules, on-chain issuance pilots, and a full virtual-assets regime.First digitally native bond on ADX (MENA first)—issued by First Abu Dhabi Bank on HSBC Orion; to list on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. You can see building blocks that let issuers and exchanges migrate product-by-product as demand and risk controls align.Bit of 2021 Q4 vibe… SubscribeLet’s look at the intraday positioning… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
