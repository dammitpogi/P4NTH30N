Market analysisVIX downside vomma 'risk', remember? + Intraday post (03/July)Jul 03, 2025∙ Paid111ShareGood morning to everyone who loves the whiff of that fresh-mattered morning NFP print.Yesterday I posted a new educational article about my trading principles covering both practical applications and principiums. Take your time to read and re-read it. Algos are set to take a recessionary print as positive-to-neutral today, while an inflationary print would be taken more like flat. Btw, last night, I digged into tariffs and datas a bit more... Tariffs act like some sales taxes on imports, raising prices at the checkout, because importers pass the duty on to consumers. In this economic environment nominal income growth underpins nominal spending growth, even tho credit growth remains dampened (DPI +0.8%, PCE +0.2% - illustrating how income gains still support spending; Consumer Credit +4.3% - below past credit-fuelled cycles).The 90 days pause led to a surge in arrivals at US ports roughly three weeks after its announcement, basically pulling forward demand masking the fact that core income dynamic still underpins the cycle. Now, core macro theory holds that when nominal incomes lag price rises, households either draw down savings, borrow more, or cut real spending. This would cause GDP growth slowdown and profit margin compression. Trump's work-visa rescissions and ICE raids already tightened the labor market. Basically any drop in foreign-born labor keeps the unemployment rate artificially low and bolsters wages, regardless of tariff policy. So it generates a wage inflation as firms are forced to pay more for scarce labor. And this is independent from the tariffs! This is crucial. Plus, across used cars, hotels/STRs, raw materials, housing, restaurants, and wages, we can see demand-pull pressures as too much demand chasing too few goods.And if I'm right, then stagflation is actually worsening and the Fed's “neutral” rate has likely shifted higher. This will tighten Fed's room again to cut rates, and this is why I see growth concerns ('bad news are bad news' regime) looming back through bonds vs equities.I want you to remember something I showed you in the weekly post… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
