Market analysisPCE - Intraday post (25/Sept)Sep 26, 2025∙ Paid10ShareIn the weekly post, I marked the 6569.00 - 6599.61 area for SPX as the area that can be produced under the on-going vomma supply. Yesterday the area was hit, volatility tempered there and market rebounded and got pinned to the local magnet of 6600. Also marked 6580.47 as the level that confirms any downside move. It was tested but held firmly, so nothing happened that breaks the structure. SubscribeI marked yesterday that SPX/yields beta is shifting towards positive, it closed above zero yesterday: pushing the short-term sentiment towards “good news are good news” territory. PCE print is important. It is expected to come at 0.28–0.35% m/m. This is because of shelter, while PCE has heavier weights on goods prices, which fell.Anyway, a print above 0.25% m/m would push three‑month annualised core PCE above 3.5%, raising doubts about disinflation.However, with this SPX/yields beta value, a very high surprise would be necessary to shake the sentiment. Algos won’t react negatively to a moderately inflationary print. But it is only short-term. The window of risk is open until buyback blackout ends in October.*update: sorry, for the late post, my internet is shit nowadays…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
