Very important piece.Weekly upside target was hit with reversion back to the expected price levels into Thursday, where I said “profit taking will occur”. Today is NFP day The sentiment is “bad news are good news”. Hiring was weaker than expected, but not collapsing. The unemployment rate fell, and wages stayed firm, producing a mixed (not dovish‑clean) signal.Job creation remains concentrated in lower‑cyclicality, lower‑wage services, while consumer‑sensitive sectors (retail) are contracting. This is consistent with a late‑cycle / cost‑controlled labor market.The labor market is not tight in a healthy way; it is stable because hiring is low and firing is low, not because demand for labor is strong.Job growth needed to keep unemployment stable is estimated at ~50k–120k, meaning this print is near maintenance, a structurally slower labor market due to demographics and immigration, not recessionary. So we can expect Fed holds near‑term rather than rushes to cut. CPI, PPI and OpEx next week…As said in the weekly post, optimism is not expected to change. SCOTUSTrump and his team have a ‘Plan B’ if SCOTUS strikes down the IEEPA-based tariffs, like pivot to other trade statutes—for example: Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.  Meanwhile, importers are preparing for a refund battle, with potential refunds as Customs will begin electronic duty refunds in Feb. And some companies have even filed preemptive lawsuits to preserve refund rights, and a secondary market has emerged where some importers are selling refund claims to hedge funds at steep discounts. Even if tariffs are invalidated, the cleanup could take months or years due to complications like documentation issues, liquidation deadlines, and possible litigation.  Bessent said that the bigger risk of an adverse ruling is losing speed and negotiating flexibility (customs revenues are now roughly $30B/month), not losing tariff revenue outright, because other legal authorities still exist  So, this will be likely a long, back-and-forth chess match, not a one-day headline.  Heavy rotation, a range-bound tape, and rising uncertainty into spring is ahead...Market expects more of this event than what its actual impact will be now.
