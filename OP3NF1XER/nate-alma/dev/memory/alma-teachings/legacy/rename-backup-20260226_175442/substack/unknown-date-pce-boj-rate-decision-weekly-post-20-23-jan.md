Market analysisPCE, BoJ rate decision | Weekly post (20-23/Jan)Jan 19, 2026∙ Paid171ShareIn this post I cover the AI/tech boom, the restructuring of the geopolitical landscape and its effects on the economy, BoJ, geography and the coming crisis: Market analysisThe challenges of 2026Alma·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significant—yet still underpriced—risk in the market.Read full storyThe gap down in futures was completely expected due to tariff headlines and structure could not hold the weekly POC of 6951.50As I kept saying, short vol and short vvol trades are overcrowded while volatility remained pinned , and spread is at 18 years lows (while it barely reached ATH in euro) providing a very fragile environment. This complacency must be washed out. With COR1M being aggressively pushed down too (usually happening before corrections):While SPX barely made new highs in terms of EUR: Rotation remains the base case, while small caps are price in a vol event into FOMC. (In my read, FOMC is priced in, vol event is only to force Powell to take steps the way DJ wishes.)Watch this zone on ES=F as it is a major sentiment shifting pivot with primal downside target of the 90-days SMA (and November lows for left-tail): The moments are very much unbalanced, and market simply cannot get enough bid to go above 7k. And I strongly think, that some volatility will come now, but not bearish turn yet. The market zone is crucial. PCE & BoJWe have PCE this week and BoJ rate decision.  Sentiment is shifting towards “bad news is bad news”/”good news is good news”, but not too big reaction.For BoJ, most coverage points to a hold at 0.75% (after the December hike to 0.75%). As said in the yearly post, I expect a pause in rate hikes during the first half of the year. Which, if markets are leaning that way too, reduces the chance of a rates shock… but it heightens the sensitivity to any sign the BoJ is drifting away from that patience. So now, carry conditions can persist.However, if communication pushes investors to price earlier tightening, US momentum stock - selling can be expected (Japanese investors have accumulated dollars and bought US equities and bonds, often unhedged, in part because the yen depreciated for years and Japanese policy rates were extremely low). It depends on how much the gov worries of the near-term import inflation. SubscribeLet’s scrutinize what the market is telling us about the structure, what is their bet..
