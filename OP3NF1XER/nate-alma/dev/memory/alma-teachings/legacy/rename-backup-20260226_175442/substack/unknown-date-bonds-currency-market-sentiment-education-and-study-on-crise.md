Market analysisBonds, Currency market, Sentiment, Education and Study on Crises, Weekly post (21-25/April)And leaked infos at the endApr 20, 2025∙ Paid3457ShareOn Friday, I shared an extended study of the current geopolitical situation and the processes that led us here. It’s crucial to understand this context, because the global economy—and therefore the entire market structure—is undergoing a profound transformation, and every market reaction today is driven first and foremost by the headlines.Last week, I also showed you that the eurozone is headed for stagflation, and that the OpEx would provide supportive flows—preventing the market from falling and volatility from spiking. Short vol, long theta positions had the edge, as I said…Based on my Friday geopolitical study, it’s important to notice that over the past week the SPX didn’t budge on any of the US–China positive processes tweeted by American politicians. That’s because investors simply aren’t buying the narrative right now: they react to concrete actions, not tweets or promises. You can see it in commodity markets—grain, soy, rare earths—where China is clearly signaling that it’s preparing for a prolonged confrontation and ready to challenge US hegemony. I’ve been saying since February that the bottom confirmation will only come with a cease‑fire and the start of sustainable US QE, likely around June.Right now, investors are pulling money out of US equities; upcoming earnings (TSLA, GOOG this week) will be weak, and the retail “buy‑the‑dip” crowd will lose its support. Trump and Xi are striving to resolve their dispute, but if Trump isn’t bluffing—despite my doubts—he risks losing his leverage over Taiwan, allowing China to take it without firing a shot. That would be a massive blow to US prestige and economy and a huge gain for China. That’s why I keep warning: the risk/reward isn’t in Trump’s favor; he’s either a hero or a zero. It’s the most dangerous game. I know many of you are eager to dive into fourth‑order greeks and vol‑of‑vol‑of‑vol‑of‑vol and other fancy non-linear quant stuffs, but one must start with macro, then drill down to micro. In today’s environment, macro leads the dance.Our job is to monitor headlines in context and watch how the markets react—first bonds, currency market, then equities. We need to monitor USD/JPY, USD/CNY, as well as the MOVE index and the U.S. Treasuries market to gauge actual headline-reactions. Equities aren’t the focus right now. Below, I’ll share a brief study of the currency and bond markets during a crisis. Take your time.The Fed is quietly running a slow, hidden QE to support the market. If realized volatility begins to track implied volatility and systematic flows (such as CTAs and volatility‑control strategies) enter the market, we may begin to see more sustained support. Remember, hidden QE’s sole purpose is to prevent a deflationary spiral; it won’t restore investor confidence. And the most important thing: investors know this!
