Market analysisBreaking down Trump's post | Another IC day - Intraday post (24/Dec)Dec 24, 2025∙ Paid1212ShareHalf-day today!Weekly post: GDP Release - Weekly post (22-26/Dec) [FREE post]Alma·December 20, 2025Read full storyThe dice are loadedYesterday the GDP and PCE datas came out how I expected: inflationary tendencies (re-accelerating actually) and ‘GDP up’, and deficit remains but it decreased a bit, while investment also decreased. Market indeed started to reprice Fed cut expectations.In the weekly post, I said, that the release will be an important sentiment-check on the mid-run. In the premarket post, I marked that it seems like, they want to hold the market up:1) on Monday close, the SPX/yields beta went up towards zero. It didn’t go positive, but it flattened the market reaction;2) we had an IC 10x times the trade size of the average position sizes, that was set just right at pivots where long downside vol positions had convexities;These two in themselves dampened the initial market reaction that was a 15 pts sell in futures, and then forced algos to bid on delta right at the open.  In regards of the weekly post, this is a discrepancy of what the market expected for the week. This is where the edge lies, because:1) If the market behaves as it is expected, then it is an easy play, sentiment remains in check, volatility remains controlled, even if the expectations are negative;2) If the market moves more above the expectations, then the sentiment is out of control (more bearish/bullish), reinforcing the trend;3) If the market divergences from the initial expectations, thats the strongest signal, because that also means that the initial positioning must be shifted providing mechanical support too. However, the trend must be confirmed!Now, Friday will be the tell if the GDP reaction was an actual shift in sentiment (even if forced) or just the temporal product of IC and mechanical flows solely on a thin tape.SubscribeAfter all these, Trump posted: This post felt literally just like if he would have answered to my last two posts I dropped during the weekend…There are some small fibs about trade deficit, investments and inflation, but the core message aligns with my “Bessent put” thesis I just wrote about few days ago, that they are about to reshape the reaction function to the economy. Trump claims that in good old days, markets were rallied on good news. Depends on what he meant by “old days”: after the dotcom bubble, it was net true until 2020, however before 90s it was exactly the opposite. As long as core inflation remains above target, market doesn’t like ‘good news’… ot it should not do…However what Trump promises by this post is that they will rig the game even more fundamentaly in order to keep the markets up. UK and US both did something similar in the 70s, and also Turkey did so two years ago driving their economy into a hyperinflation. All of these ended up in forced tightenings after.What’s the purpose? Well, if you get GDP up/prices up and policymakers still try to push easier conditions, the best case is a “financial repression” with lower real rates that erode the real burden of debt, but at the cost of higher inflation volatility and distortions.However there is a risk that long-end yields still rise, and so debt service can worsen. And this is were the Bessent-put comes into play…They expand long-end buyback operations and aim to keep vol low. But this will keep inflation sticky again. This tells me that Trump wants to bring back the post-WW2 “yield curve control” scheme later.The Fed implemented a form of yield-curve targeting, capping rates at multiple maturities (famously ~2.5% on long bonds). This made mortgages, corporate loans, and other investments cheaper, stimulating the economy.The market rallied like ~135% from 1942 to 1951 March, when they unwound this regime. Because once inflation pressures rise, holding down long yields can require balance-sheet expansion and/or regulation-like controls, which can undermine credibility and create an eventual break. Now, you can see a three-years long bearmarket started in 1946 May.This was because of sharp reflation after price controls were eliminated. As a result of YCC, bill yields pegged at 0.375% and the long bond capped at 2.5%, with the Fed having to buy securities to defend the structure if markets didn’t want to hold them at those yields. Now, even if nominal yields were anchored, real yields could become sharply negative during the inflation spike, creating a noisy valuation environment.Later, as inflation expectations persisted, Fed went for tightening in 1948, and the economy entered its first postwar recession in Nov of 1948, and then the cycle reset. We have however this AI-boom too, that is supportive only if the developments deliver real productivity, shifting the environment towards positive supply-side shock. But the risk is high that the AI is demand today but won’t become a supply tomorrow. Debt/GDP could look better in nominal terms, but productivity would be lower and capital allocation would degrade. And this would produce a very similar or “rhyming” pattern of what happened in the last century. On the short-runThis will hold up the markets artificially and win the mid-term elections at any cost.The game is rigged, I don’t consider it as a good investing environment into risk assets, nor for longer-term trades. I’m scaling out of some longer-term positions, took profit from Nov 20 longs, and will take new ones only if a pullback happens, potentially around spring. In my “playing the AI bubble post” I marked 8k+ target as max for the cycle under Trump. I will refresh this post soon. As the market is rigged, I do not play any downside, as I keep emphatizing. When I see risk, I hedge volatility solely, not spot direction. I use the dips to take long positions, but I see no edge in shorting, not because it can’t go down, but because the market is heavily manipulated towards teh upside until reality hits. But not now…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
