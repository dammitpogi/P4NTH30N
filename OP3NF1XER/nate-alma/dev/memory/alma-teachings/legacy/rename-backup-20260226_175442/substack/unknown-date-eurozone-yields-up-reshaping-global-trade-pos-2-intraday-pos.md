Market analysisEurozone yields-up, reshaping global trade (PoS-2) - Intraday post (03/Sept)Sep 03, 2025∙ Paid111ShareMonthly and weekly post is here: SEPTEMBER - Monthly & Weekly post (02-05/Sept)Alma·September 1, 2025Read full storyDespite long-dated yields spike in Europe, volatility remained in check, manifested through spot: But voilá, look and see: This is how accurately my formulas work… and this is the importance of these zones. Monthly volatility closed at 9.41% from 9.46%, 3-monthly went up by 0.1 bps, and vol of vol by 2.2 bps, despite a sudden 112 pts candle. Spot is staying under control, volatility remains supplied, but set to start to grind up, widening the area of ranging for spot. Europe yield rise I noted this yield spike yesterday premarket, but let me tell you why it is important…As long yields grind higher on fiscal/term-premium worries, rich multiples face a headwind. Big Tech/AI names are “long-duration” (more of their value is far in the future). When long-end (especially the real one) yields rise, the present value of those cash flows falls, so P/Es contract and the Nasdaq underperforms. So the opportunity cost of holding expensive growth stocks increases. This is what we saw yesterday. Now, because stock-bond correlation is positive, investors’ portfolios get hit from two sides and some systematic players de-risk (like me as-well). Markets are re-pricing a higher long-end term premium tied to deficits/debt supply and tariff/inflation frictions. It has begun. Even if Fed cut rates, yields will remain sticky. This recognization will cause some volatility ahead… SubscribeFor investors, economistsNow, I must talk to the investors here about oil, tech, global economy reshift in regards of Putin/Xi meeting… If it’s not your business, scroll down.What’s going on… The meeting was scheduled to the SCO/WWII-anniversary week in China, using it to flaunt a non-Western bloc and to sign/announce a raft of cooperation items with Russia. India’s Modi was there for the SCO and met both Xi and Putin. Moscow and Beijing just “blessed” PoS-2—50 bcm/yr from West Siberia to China via Mongolia. It’s not a full commercial close yet (pricing/financing still opaque), but Russia permanently re-routes gas once bound for Europe; China locks in overland supply leverage. Markets noticed (Gazprom sold off on terms risk). Even as China sits closer to Russia, Washington just opened a narrow channel: Nvidia/AMD get export licenses for downgraded AI chips to China under a novel 15%-of-revenue skim to the U.S. government. That’s a political/transactional carve-out, not a full thaw—Beijing still can’t get top chips. Trump publicly squeezed India (tariff threats tied to Russian oil), but still India remains a top buyer of Russian crude and is visibly cordial with Putin/Xi this week. That puts New Delhi in position as a broker—and as a beneficiary of discounted energy—while it resists picking a side.Washington also kept pressing Abu Dhabi to curtail sanction-evasion routing, but Dubai remains a key financial/logistics node for Russia-adjacent trade. This friend-shore option is still part of the toolkit the Beijing crowd can use even as they trumpet new formal deals. After talks with Xi and Modi, Putin said “NATO enlargement has to be addressed” for Ukraine peace and referenced “Trump summit understandings”, in order to test a ceasefire/settlement framework while the economic architecture is being built.Longer-term, this pressures global LNG utilisation/margins into the 2030s and dilutes Europe’s leverage over Russian gas. Reuters even notes PoS-2 helps Beijing hedge future reliance on US LNG.Also, near-term Brent is driven more by OPEC+ policy and war-related outages than by the Beijing optics, but the summit reinforces the durability of the India/China demand sink for Russian crude.The U.S.–China chip carve-out survives (with political heat), letting China keep building AI capacity; that indirectly cushions Russia’s tech access. Xi also advances yuan-centric settlement across the SCO periphery. Dollar will be kept burning. Let’s jump to the intraday positioning… Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
