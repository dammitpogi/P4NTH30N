Market analysisVol selling + Intraday post (03/June)Jun 03, 2025∙ Paid123ShareThe admin won’t let this market to crash for now. As said, June OpEx looks supportive, and the whole market just looks rangebounding on vol and vvol supply. At least until late July - early August.I will tell when I see the opportunity for a trend-trade (and that will be on the short side most likely). Let’s go through some datas…By May 30, USD/JPY traded around 144.04, down from an average near 149 earlier in 2025—a yen appreciation of ≈3 % over the month. This signals a global risk-off shift. The relative performance of Consumer Discretionary vs Consumer Staples (the XLY/XLP ratio) has collapsed to fresh lows. Recent flows show hedge funds dumping discretionary names amid concern over tariffs and spending, while staples have caught a defensive bid. A lower XLY/XLP ratio means investors favor essentials (staples) over big-ticket, cyclical goods (discretionary). The DJTA fell from 14 831.24 on May 27 to 14 686.30 by May 30—a decline of about 1.0 % over those three sessions. This indicates slowing demand and can foreshadow broader equity weakness.U.S. 10-year yields swung from a peak near 4.62 % (mid-May) down to 4.16 % by month-end, then back into the 4.4 % area—in one week alone they moved >40 bp. Such intra-month whipsaws reflect deep uncertainty over tariffs, Fed policy, and global liquidity.Spot gold closed May 30 at $3 315.48/oz, up +1.69 % on the day—and roughly +2 % over the prior two sessions. This uptick (a safe-haven rally) confirms inflation fears + risk aversion. Despite mixed headlines, tamer PCE data kept real yields low, allowing gold to rally.The Markit CDX North American IG Index (5-year) widened to 64.9 bp on April 3 (highest since Nov 2023), then constricted back toward the mid-30 bp area by May 30, ending at 32.82 bp—a ~50 % retracement. This means spreads are tightening, implying investors are less fearful of defaults. However, this tightening may be more liquidity-driven (banks chasing carry) than confidence-driven—a hallmark of slippery, short-lived rallies until macro/event risk eases.
