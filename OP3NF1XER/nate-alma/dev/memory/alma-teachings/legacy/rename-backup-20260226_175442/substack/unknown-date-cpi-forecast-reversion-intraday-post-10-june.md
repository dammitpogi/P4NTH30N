Market analysisCPI forecast, Reversion + Intraday post (10/June)Jun 10, 2025∙ Paid1811ShareFirst lets look at the SPX/LTY beta:Market shows less and less fear of inflation now, but beta is still negative, meaning, a soft CPI print (or any print within the expectations) typically drives yields lower (as it stokes Fed‐easing bets) and lifts equities.Analysts broadly expect May CPI to show mild headline inflation (+0.16% m/m; +2.4% y/y) and core inflation (+0.27% m/m; +2.9% y/y). Persistent readings above 0.3% m/m could force the Fed to delay cuts further, while soft print buys time for Fed cuts and a quieter Q3. Any upside surprise would trigger stairstep selloff into midsummer tariff shock. If CPI stays sticky while growth slows, the Fed faces persistent stagflation and bearish Q3. SubscribeThe reversion model shows 79.45% probability for a reversion. Momentum wise, as long as SPX holds above 5931.39, ES=F above 5949.05, and VIX below 18.58s, the momentum is not net bearish.I start to scale in based on the probability value, and ready to size up if these levels are proved.
