Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)Aug 24, 2025∙ Paid136ShareLast week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.I predicted sell-off and vol up for Tuesday and Wednesday and stabilization after, it happened, then on Friday I warned that if Powell is benign, market will spike back up to 6430 (it overshot). So the momentum was there, but it was never confirmed as spot failed to close below the weekly range.I also warned during the week (when market was still down) that the risk window probability is shifting towards the second half of September, implying that this downside momentum won’t see continuation.I tell you why…What’s happening is clear salesman-business on the market.1) if you can create a narrative that makes funds short the long end of the inflation curve, they won’t decrease their long-exposures;2) positive monthly SPX/yields betas on the short-end makes investors increase their long exposures on equities if yields are being sold - something Bessent is sweating to do;3) you can heavily sell the skew and vomma for the dealers to create constant short speed and short vanna profiles, levering up the buy-the-dip flows while simultaniously dampen any possible vol spikes through them (basically selling wide fly spreads on different tenors), creating a positively skewed platykurtic distribution4) as risk is meassured in two dimensions (spot and time axis), with these managed sell-offs the mean reversion algos, momentum and volatility based risk metrics can be cooled down, so funds can increase exposures while buying back hedges (and in case of options, the flow is levered up through them); This is only four ways to manage the downside and create an artificial stairstep-up move, that pulls in more speculative buyers further reinforcing the move. The reason is simple: they need to create a good sentiment for the market in order to win investors confidence. If market would be down, the sentiment would not favor to make investors valuate this market too high. But as the performance is good, and market is very much seems to be valuated high on this rate cut thing, investors might get more confidence, so do long-term traders. This way, the underlying uncertainity about the hawkish side of this cut (instead of a new stable QE-cycle) can be masked, and a “low value product can be sold for higher price”. Because the reason is not disfinlation, but recession risk. But it will matter only until the cut happens. For now, the only goal is to valuate this market as high as it can be to hold sentiment pumped. Just salesman-thing… SubscribeAs you can see the new highs didn’t triggered new red dot yet: I warned you here for the scenario I suspect… Mean reversion signal UPDATE!Alma·August 13, 2025Read full storyAnd here: Near-term outlook, Free-education about principles, Risk window - Intraday post (13/08)Alma·August 13, 2025Read full storyStill, the market is heading towards equilibrium, thats were selling is starting to happen. I don’t take time series analysis too serious but it also aligns with primal target of 2nd half of Sept and November as secondary. For now it says, market should produce above 6480.97 in the next five days to brake the downtrend of the purple line a bit.
