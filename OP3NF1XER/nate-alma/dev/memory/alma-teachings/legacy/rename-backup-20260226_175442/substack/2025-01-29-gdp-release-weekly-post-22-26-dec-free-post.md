Market analysisGDP Release - Weekly post (22-26/Dec) [FREE post]Sentiment breakdown, GDP, Positioning breakdownDec 20, 2025274ShareOn Dec 24, market closes at 1PM ET, and will be closed on Dec 25Liquidity vacuumLast week, the retest of the gap is happened as expected, however, as you will see below, the market is not convinced that the gap was actuall filled with liquidity. On Thursday and Friday and market formed too more gaps after some higher volatility days, that makes the zone still fragile. The weekly POC also falls at 6810, just above the gap. The positioning shows that market is still concerned about this liquidity vacuum downward, and it expects that to persist.It read like the market wants either “go up” on being optimistic, above 6900 now, or go down and retest the past weeks lows and build a “basis” there, before going up.GDP releaseMarket expects more local liquidity upward than downward, but there will be a significant sentiment-check on Tuesday: GDPThis is effectively the first official “clean” read on Q3 (BEA is doing two estimates instead of the usual three). The updated estimate (standing in for a typical third estimate) is scheduled for Jan 22, 2026.The common calendar consensus reading right now clusters around 3.2%, but Fed GDPNow has been running above that—about 3.5% (as of Dec 16), implying modest upside risk versus consensus. The SPX/yields beta for pricing in inflation scare:This print will decide if market believes in room for more upside this week, or if it frontrunned itself. If the data is weak, the market sees more Fed easing ahead. If the data comes strong that will erase the concerns about the future easing cycle. And market needs that liquidity. It will eventually get that, no doubt about it, the only question is: when.With a lot of datas missing, the odds are high that prints will be manipulated into a supportive print.If the print is “positive supply-side shock”-ish (GDP up/prices down), that is the risk-on scenario.If the print is “negative demand-side shock”-ish (GDP down/prices down), that is also benign, however the initial reaction will be pessimistic. If the print is “positive demand-side shock”-ish (GDP up/prices up), the initial reaction will also be pessimistic as market re-prices its Fed cut odds. But if data is not hot, it also can get a benign read on the short-run too.If the print is “negative supply-side shock”-ish (GDP down/prices up),that’s the stagflationary print, and market will not be happy at all.Based on my modelling, the most likely outcome is between the first and third outcome: GDP modestly above consensus, with the inflation measures (GDP price index/PCE prices in the GDP report) in-line to slightly softer than expected. Skewed towards “in-line”, that is still price increase. So, given that it will get a “datas were not fully collected” foggy narrative, this can take some time to digest positively.SubscribeBelow, I cover what the positioning says and what are the key levels derived from the volatility structure. And I will explain, step-by-step the conclusions… WEEKLY POSITIONING BREAKDOWNWEEKLY POSTHere is the weekly positioning:Speed profile The net speed profile is flat-to-positive. Customers are selling vol into both direction, but slightly more RV is being sold to the upside. The centroid of the profile is at 6798.90,but in order to get a proper stabilisation SPX needs to get above 6915.75, with a magnet clustering around 6928.60To the downside, the pivot is at 6688.88, with the most supportive cluster at 6670.34With the RV profile, market leaves a bit more room for downside moves, but aims to swallow it if it happens, while to the upside, it is net stabilization.Let’s see, what the forward vol positioning tells us…Positioning derivativesNet gamma is positve, locally too, meaning customers expect compressed daily moves overall. Net color is negative until Thursday, then flips to positive into Friday, meaning, they leave a little room for momentum into midweek, but expect the spot to stabilize into Friday. Local magnets will come into effect.Net zomma is positive until Thursday, meaning participants expect missvalued volatility to take advange of, as IV/RV relationship is expected to remain inverse, but it flips to negative onto Friday, increasing the IV/RV correlation.Net vega is positive, butNet veta is negative and steeply so, meaning after an initial low IV state, they expect vol to increase into Friday. Net vomma is positive over the week, meaning, any volatility move is expected to be capped into both ways. The more vol is being bid, the more MMs will sell, and vice versa. Ultima profile says there is significantly more vomma effect to vol down moves, but it shifts into Friday. Net vanna is positive and very strong this week. So market expects shorter spot/vol beta to normalize, with supportive vol decay and suppressive vol expansion. Let’s try to put it together, what it tells us…First, I want to say that the profile is beautifully consistent. Let me explain step by step.Both gamma decay and vega decay are priced to be negative this week. This means both realized volatility and implied volatility are expected to increase over the week. However, the slope is different and this is consistent with the zomma exposure!IV expansion is expected to be concave with a firm support from the lower levels due to higher downside ultima exposure (more vomma to buyback if vol decreases, creating a path of the least resistance to the upside for vol), however veta decay weakens as time passes and upside ultima increases creating a growing concavity to the upside. The RV expansion is way more flat, because 1) long zomma counterbalances the decay, and 2) the short downside speed also creates heavy upside concavity for RV. By modelling this, RV is rather expected to net rangebound with a flat positive drift, than increase convexly. And into Friday the RV is expected to be dumped but with a higher low. If it plays out, this means, IV also will be slightly down on Friday. What does it mean for SPX spot?Well, the IV/spot relationship is expected to be inverse due the to very heavy long vanna exposure. This means, the long skew traders expect to hit downside levels on the implied vol increase (see the vol projected ranges below). The RV expectation adds a bit more shade however…The speed profile is net flat-to-positive, this means a net very weak negative correlation between spot and RV, so this means, the net drift of the spot is expected to be rather net down until Friday. However, this is only a net expectation and very flat, almost zero correlation. The story depends on, which side of the centroid the spot is trading at.Because downside speed is sold and upside speed is bought by MMs, this says, that the market expects a rangebound around the centroid with a net flat-to-negative drift until Friday. But this rangebound is expected to widen from day to day, until it stabilizes into Friday potentially above the centroid. But this path is conditional: if spot is above the centroid into Friday in average, then the vol crush is expected to stabilize the spot upward. If it trades below the centroid on a net basis into Friday, then the stabilization is expected to be downward. Now, given the low (almost zero) asymmetry of the profile, and the increased correlation of IV/RV along with long vanna on Friday, it hints that the former scenario is the primal bet, with a flat weekly close. Do not be married to it! Positioning can drastically change, macro can surprise. Use this only as a base idea what the market is expecting.The key idea is that the market primarly expects a slight positive drift in vol, and long skew trades to catch a bid on uncertainity over the week, then stabilize the sentiment into Friday. Vomma rangesThe ranges for SPX that I can derive from vomma selling expectations, are at6691.65 - 6737.50 to the downside, and6910.23 - 6946.04 to the upside.These are the zones that are expected to be produced by a vol increase and decrease where vomma steps in the hardest. You can see the asymmetric expectations to the downside caused by the ultima and vanna exposures.Also note, that the lower bound of the upside zone is just 5 pts under the upside pivot derived from the speed profile, where the market aready expects stabilization.While, the downside pivot is 3 pts below the lower bound of the dowside zone. Farther from the point where the market expects downside stabilization.So given this asymmetrical expectation for the vomma to kick in, it kinda hints me that market has a “hidden reversion expectation” in the worst case too, if everything remains under control.Fixed strike skew is bid, especially on the tails by 66.69%However the whole smirk moved downwards by ~32.07% The bid comes from heavy selling of 22-delta puts and even more 22-delta calls relative to the tail contracts. This also projects me a sentiment where participants have no real fear, but they expect to capitalize on long skew and short vomma trades during the week. All in all, the market expects undervaluedvalued uncertainity potential for the next week, that is reinforced by a negative drift in spot until mid-week, then we can see some contructive flows, but sentiment will remain moderated, skewed towards pessimism.For the GDP, the market sentiment is “bad news is good news”/”good news is bad news”. The sentiment flips based on how fast the data print can be turned into a bullish narrative on this week.For Monday, the risk appetite expected to be moderate but slightly positive. For Tuesday, the GDP release can cause some increased uncertainity first. This release will be effectively the first official clean read on Q3. Market needs some time to digest it. I expect a moderated net negative sentiment, lowering risk appetit, and market needs to revaluate the datas one the longer horizont. The “inflation scare” vs. “growth scare” narrative may take some time to kick in about the datas.For Wednesday, we can expect a dull day, with some swing position close ahead of the holiday. Risk appetite expected to remain moderate. For Friday, we can expect the weekly sentiment to be stabilized. A bit more hint for pessimism, but we will see how we arrive into Friday, as said above.The expected distribution looks like this:The described expectation is derived purely from the positioning ahead.Don’t be married to it. Use it only to have any idea about how the market as a whole reads now the structure. The discrepancies and deviations from the expected structure is what reveals the next move for us.
