Market analysisVol selling, geo-risk premium + Intraday post (13/June)Jun 13, 2025∙ Paid101ShareSPX is trading at 5987.3 when I’m writing these lines…Got a nice 130 pts profit on Wednesday shorts during the overnight. Today is again a wait-and-observe day. The reason is because, after profiting this much, I simply don’t feel the need to gamble if the market is trading in a pivotal zone. The overnight decline is explained by the Iran - Israel conflict, but in fact, it was an inevitable result of the weekly volatility flows as I explained on Sunday, reinforced by the data releases (sentiment shift) and amplified by the attack. Look where realized vvol is trading and where implied vomma is trading: Synthetic tail OTM SPX put selling is still there but MM delta is making higher lows in a net basis. Market is still complacent, despite SPX fix strike skew spiked yesterday on weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. But again: vol selling is still on (suppressive for any upside move, but stabilizing for any downside move).SubscribeThe U.S. dollar has fallen to its lowest in over three years amid cooling inflation prints and tariff relief hopes, as traders push out Fed-cut expectations to September and beyond. Because despite near-target inflation, uncertainties from tariffs and a swelling federal deficit are keeping the Fed cautious on policy shifts. If Israel refrains from additional attacks, the risk premium in oil is likely to fade—making a sustained jump above current levels unlikely. These Middle East tensions inject a clear downside risk into global equities by threatening the U.S. disinflation narrative—a sudden oil shock could undo recent gains against inflation and force investors into safer, less risky assets.Basically near-term volatility hinges on the next moves in Jerusalem and Tehran; without a fresh cycle of strikes, the geo-premium should recede, but any new escalation will keep energy markets jittery and equity risk premia elevated. Here are the levels that matter from sentiment-wise: SPX: 5968ES=F: 5976.81SPY: 595.89NDX: 21,585NQ=F: 21,620.68VIX: 18.60 - 22.33VVIX: 96.00 - 103.15Continued vol selling will keep market swings contained, favoring premium-selling strategies and liquidity-providing chops, supportive from the downside for now. Except if vol-of-vol event happens (e.g., credit shock, geopolitical flashpoint), reversing vol positioning and swallowing all the downside gammas.
