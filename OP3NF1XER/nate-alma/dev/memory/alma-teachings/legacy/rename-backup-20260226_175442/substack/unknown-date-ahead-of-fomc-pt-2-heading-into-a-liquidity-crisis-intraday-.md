Market analysisAhead of FOMC Pt. 2 : Heading into a liquidity crisis Intraday post (06/May)Educative contentMay 06, 2025∙ Paid201ShareWeekly postAfter reading my yesterday post, look Yesterday I posted this on Twitter: Now look at inflation expectations: Note, that the inflection points of the M2 coincidences with upsticks of inflation expectations, hinting that market participants and consumers view broad liquidity as a key driver of prices. Key to understand my bulltrap-call.Let, me explain…ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid Index returned to expansion in October 2024 near ~55% and climbed to 69.8% in April, its highest since June 2022, and the ISM Non‐Manufacturing Prices Paid Index similarly jumped from ~58% in October 2024 to 65.1% in April, its strongest pace since January 2023. Readings above 50 % signal that a majority of firms are paying more for inputs. Both surveys have spent seven straight months above 60 %, consistent with sustained price pressures. Swings of 4–5 points month‐to‐month (e.g., Dec +4.0 pts, Apr +4.2 pts) reflect tariff cycles, commodity‐price moves (steel, lumber) and freight bottlenecks—all passing through into higher procurement costs.In Manufacturing, five of the six largest industries (Machinery; Chemicals; Food & Beverage; Electronics; Transportation Equipment) reported higher raw‐material costs in April, while in Services, arts & recreation was the only segment reporting lower input costs; all others are paying more—indicating ubiquitous supply‐chain strain.This means that despite Fed tightening, input‐cost inflation remains entrenched. A Prices Paid index above 60% historically maps to PPI increases well above target and eventually prints into CPI. And this is strongly against rate cuts. And the margin squeeze, that firms face shrinking margins unless they pass costs onto consumers, in a slowing economy, increasing stagflation. Sharp input‐price spikes often precede equity pullbacks and Treasury sell‐offs, as investors reprice Fed‐cut odds downward—heightening the risk of “sell‐the‐fact” moves around FOMC and tariff‐decision events.Plus add, that major ports—led by Los Angeles—are seeing 30–35% plunges in China cargo volumes, freight cancellations have surged, and retail inventories, while temporarily elevated, will run down over a 6–8-week buffer. Localized stockouts are already surfacing, but widespread empty shelves are expected within the next week unless shipments rebound—a scenario rendered unlikely without a rapid tariff resolution.So, empty‐shelf shortages have not yet fully materialized, but the supply buildup from stockpiling has masked the sudden drop in imports, setting the stage for visible out-of-stocks by around May 10. And this will lift wholesale prices and compress retailer margins, eventually spilling into CPI data.Fed MUST  wait for the true tariff-shock recession and supply-shock inflation to appear in hard data, in order to decide what to do next QT or QE. Watch retail and logistics stocks as early indicators; a sudden uptick in inventory write-downs or guidance cuts will be a red flag that empty-shelf pain is surfacing.The summer liquidity crisis prediction is getting stronger. Plus, US/CN relationship doesn’t look good at all…Plus, this is ECB day, that I marked many times during April as a risk event, but not only that. There’s something very important that many misses…Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
