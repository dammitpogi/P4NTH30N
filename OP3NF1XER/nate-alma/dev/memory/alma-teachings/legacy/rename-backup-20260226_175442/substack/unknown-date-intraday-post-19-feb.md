Market analysisIntraday post (19/feb)Feb 19, 2025∙ Paid1521ShareFirst, lets look at CME FedWatch tool: A quick walkthrough: Fed funds futures are quoted as 100 minus the expected effective rate: Implied Rate=100− Futures PriceFed always sets a target range for the fed funds rate. The FedWatch tool compares the implied rate to the current target range. If the implied rate is lower than the current range, the market expects rate cuts (or a lower effective rate), and if it’s higher, it expects rate hikes.As cuts/hikes typically occur in increments of 25 basis points, the tool uses the difference between the implied rate and the current target rate (often the midpoint of the target range) to estimate the probability of a change. Of course, they consider the term structure of the futures, etc. So this way, looking at the current pricing of fed funds futures, the tool tells us how many basis points the market expects the fed funds rate to change by a given date.Here you can read their methodology more in depth. As you can see, market prices 97.5% probability for no cuts in March, 55.4% into June, and 18.6% into Dec, betting with 37% probability for a 25bps cut, and this is the highest bet. The sentiment turns in July. So basically the market only expects only one rate cut this year. Here I explained that the current higher inflation prints were natural and don’t actually reflect the inflation trend. Of course, this reports are mostly fake, but we have to follow the narrative that they want to sell us, we can’t be bearish if they want to boost the market and economy. The key takeaway here is that we already saw last week, that the market prices in sticky inflation, and doesn’t really expect further easing. This is something to keep in mind, everything else is just temporal market speculation to collect premium and catch alpha through event vol spikes. Bad news are no news, but in an evironment like this, good news are very good news.
