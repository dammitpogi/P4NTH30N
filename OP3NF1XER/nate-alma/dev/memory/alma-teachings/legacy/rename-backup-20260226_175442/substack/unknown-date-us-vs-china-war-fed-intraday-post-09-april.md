Market analysisUS vs China war, Fed, + Intraday post (09/April)This is not 2008/09Apr 09, 2025∙ Paid3962ShareFirst of all, I’m linking here my article on geopolitics and the New World Order geostrategy, which provides the overall context of the global situation.You can find this article pinned in the “Market analysis” category. I want to draw your attention to the fact that I’ll be continuously adding the most important updates to it.I ask everyone to study it, because these things are happening—and they’re happening right now. The US - China pokergameYesterday after the close, I explained that Trump is playing a very dangerous poker game with Xi.As I’ve stated many times, the goal of these tariffs is to force opponents to negotiate, banking on a controlled level of market panic that is then contained through swift policy action.I also explained that, according to historical political patterns, in times of crisis, the central parties cannot cooperate; rather, they gravitate toward their extreme ‘cousins’: the right goes toward the far-right (nationalists), and the left goes toward the far-left (communists). The reason for this is their shared ideological roots, from which similar economic policies and geostrategic views follow.Consequently, the European Union—specifically the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ that represents the left—is searching for alternative alliances and new sources to maintain their current global-capitalist mode of operation. China is the communist superpower in the world. This shift is becoming increasingly visible to everyone.Since Trump’s goal is to bring the EU to its knees by 1) exposing the European economy to recession—even deflation—and 2) exerting pressure on voter sentiment so they replace the uncooperative left-wing leaders, he must act very quickly with this tactic. Because if the EU finds new sources and allies with China, that will have serious consequences for the US... and for world security.Indeed, the EU will not sit down to negotiate with the US, nor will it accept the ceasefire agreement that Putin is asking for—and that Trump must secure. This will derail the ‘Holy Alliance 2.0’ plan, the US will face a severe economic downturn, and global security will be permanently shaken.With a new backer behind it, the EU can sustain the conflict with Russia, hoping for victory, while a weakened US becomes an easier target for China, which can then reclaim Taiwan.Needless to say, at that point there would be no more talk of NATO or the EU.Dormant conflicts would awaken, and the long-awaited world war would break out.(In Trump’s defense, it’s worth emphasizing that it wasn’t Trump who led the world to this point. Trump merely took on the conflict. Those who violated the NATO–CSTO agreements in the past 30+ years, and globalized the Ukrainian–Russian conflict instead of localizing it, are the ones who brought the world here. (These are very specific political definitions—look them up.)Likewise, those who allowed stagflation to develop—who stimulated Western economies on the demand side, instead of fixing the supply side after COVID—share blame. Then we wouldn’t have stagflation now.Many poor and shortsighted decisions have led us to this point.)The stakes are extremely high. Trump must act quickly with tariffs on the EU, or else his plan will fail. There’s no turning back—doing so would be a show of weakness. The problem is stagflation, which tariffs and debt selling (as I previously predicted) only make worse.The deficit-to-GDP ratio is large and continues to grow. Printing money can only cover rising government spending in the short term, because the real value of money declines.Then investors begin to sell dollars. In addition, as investors gradually offload their U.S. Treasuries, there will be no one to finance the country’s expenses. What’s more, interest rates will rise as a result. Government revenues go down. And if the government tries to fund itself through taxes, it slows the economy. All of this erodes U.S. hegemony and its influence on global economic processes.Meanwhile, the slowly awakening conflicts dissipate U.S. military power and generate further expenses. Russia and the Middle East have offered to finance the U.S. in the future, but trust is eroding worldwide rather than growing.The poker game here is that the U.S. has to push matters to the extreme in order to shake the global economy. Everyone must believe we’re sliding into a deflationary spiral. The U.S. has every tool, all the money, and sufficient gold reserves to maintain its military and survive an economic crisis vis-à-vis China and the EU. (By ‘survive,’ I mean preserving its power in the global economy.)However, the risk/reward ratio does not favor the U.S. this time. If confidence among Middle Eastern and Russian investors were permanently undermined, they could back out of the agreements previously negotiated and refuse to finance the U.S. in the future.And domestically, under globalist leadership, American society could wipe Trump out of government altogether through an american civil war. That’s a very serious risk. Xi therefore hopes that Trump will fold his hand prematurely, in any sense.The U.S.–China economic war - that I keep talking about in the past 3 years - has begun. It is not a cold war anymore. Difficult and very risky times lie ahead, and we face an increasing number of unpredictable events that hinge on the decisions and moods of world leaders and billionaires. (Most of those are irrational)The world order is changing.Fed is in troubleTariffs are expected to weaken hiring and spending, pushing the economy closer to recession. However, these same tariffs are likely to raise prices on many imported goods and materials, which feeds into overall inflation and gives central bankers pause about loosening policy too early.Because of these conflicting pressures, rate cuts (which could help with growth) might worsen inflation, while maintaining higher rates to curb inflation could deepen a slowdown in employment and spending.Economists, business owners, and investors are already betting that the combined effects of tariffs will push the economy toward recession. Many are expecting that when the economy begins to slow sharply, the Fed will eventually need to cut rates. However, there’s considerable uncertainty—investors are not convinced that the Fed can swing the policy needle quickly or decisively enough to avoid negative fallout. If business sentiment deteriorates due to the tariff shock, and if the Fed is seen as too slow to counteract it, the credibility of U.S. monetary policy could be undermined. Powell’s standpoint is to fully understand the economic impact before making a major policy change. He’s waiting to see a significant weakening in the labor market or a clear signal from inflation data before taking action. But delaying a rate cut too long might allow the slowdown to deepen, while an early move could ignite persistent inflation.From this, you can see exactly what Xi is playing at.He knows there are still those who would bail out and finance the U.S. economy. He also knows that if China and the EU (plus the BRICS as a whole) buckle, Trump will roll back most of the tariffs. This is crucial.But Xi is trying to drag this out until the loss of confidence in the U.S. is too great and the U.S. backs down from the economic war.
