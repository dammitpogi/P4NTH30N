## Introduction & Community

### A Year Is Over...

Well, eleven months have passed since I launched my Substack blog—after, in 2024, you had been asking me for more than half a year to create a private place where I could share my analyses. And I'll be completely honest: I didn't think it would be this successful. At the beginning, I expected maybe 20–30 people would subscribe; today, however, I'm at 2,494 subscribers.

Both the community and I have been through important trials—and a kind of purification. From the community, those have fallen away who were only looking for a free lunch, as well as people coming from other businesses who merely wanted to copy my code and sell it within their own service, and who tried to demoralize the community with fabricated accusations.

And so what remained is a wonderful, diverse community—full of both highly experienced and less experienced people: market makers, fund managers, and retail traders—united by curiosity, a spirit of exploration, and, most importantly, the humility all of this requires.

This is a community that, by multiple testimonials, is inspiring; it excludes no one and insults no one. Some have started university studies because of it; others were finally able to leave their 8-hour-a-day job. I've received countless thank-you messages.

Thank you so much. I'm truly grateful to every one of you, and I'll keep doing my best to provide analyses worthy of you.

### 3 Latest Weekly Posts Have Been Set Free

On Feb 1 and Feb 8 and Feb 15 Sundays, my weekly posts precisely predicted the weekly momentums: the volatile Feb 3, the consolidation, levels, and the rebound on Feb 6; then the Feb 8 post precisely predicted the mid-week volatility, "bad news is good news" sentiment and the levels. Later, this last week, the weekly post precisely foretold the Monday-Tuesday wider ranging, Wednesday melt-up, Thursday consolidation, and Friday benign retest of support and rebound followed by snapback, after everybody went full bear for this week.

You can take a look into my "Guestbook".

These are derived from my own models based on customer positioning purchased from exchanges (including CBOE). In the posts, I always explain my thinking method in details. Now, I decided to set them to freely available for everyone, so you can read and study them if you wish. I also happy to announce that a Python course is available on my Substack site for beginner and advanced quant students for discount price!

## Educational Content

### A Guide to Reading My Daily Posts

**Date:** unknown  
**Source:** https://stochvoltrader.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-reading-my-daily-posts

Every time you look at tools such as put/call deltas, ratios, or even monitor changes in order flow (e.g., the ratio between selling and buying volume), you get lagging data.

By contrast, my method is to reverse-engineer the structure the market is pricing in, decode the hidden patterns (short or long butterfly spreads or risk-reversal patterns), and derive both the key pivot ranges from expected flows and the implied distribution that the market is pricing in. As I've already written in my earlier educational posts about trading strategies, the pivot and the probability levels primarily function as checkpoints that provide information about the given price action and the underlying sentiment. I mark downside and upside targets, as well as local pinning and additional supportive/suppressive targets, separately.

#### My Daily Post Contains:

1. **A premarket OptionsDepth Heatmap**
2. **Script inputs** (levels with assigned probabilities)
3. **Speed profile description**
4. **Vanna flip, speed slip**
