Powell emphasized latest inflation uptick driven by external tariff-related sources. Fed announced QT slowdown from $25B to $5B monthly supporting short-end yield decline and front-end spread widening. U.S. rates fell, yield curve steepened on downside risks, USD depreciated slightly. Powell's press conference more dovish than SEP implied dismissing longer-term inflation expectations as outliers. SEP showed heavy skew toward weaker economic activity and higher inflation risks with median projections for two 25bp cuts in 2025-2026 but dot plot distribution indicating substantial uncertainty with many participants anticipating fewer cuts.
