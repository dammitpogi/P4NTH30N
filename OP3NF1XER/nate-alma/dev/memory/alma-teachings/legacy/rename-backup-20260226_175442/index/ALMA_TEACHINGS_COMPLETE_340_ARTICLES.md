A year is over...Dec 31, 20252842ShareWell, eleven months have passed since I launched my Substack blogâ€”after, in 2024, you had been asking me for more than half a year to create a private place where I could share my analyses. And Iâ€™ll be completely honest: I didnâ€™t think it would be this successful. At the beginning, I expected maybe 20â€“30 people would subscribe; today, however, Iâ€™m at 2,494 subscribers.Both the community and I have been through important trialsâ€”and a kind of purification. From the community, those have fallen away who were only looking for a free lunch, as well as people coming from other businesses who merely wanted to copy my code and sell it within their own service, and who tried to demoralize the community with fabricated accusations.And so what remained is a wonderful, diverse communityâ€”full of both highly experienced and less experienced people: market makers, fund managers, and retail tradersâ€”united by curiosity, a spirit of exploration, and, most importantly, the humility all of this requires.This is a community that, by multiple testimonials, is inspiring; it excludes no one and insults no one. Some have started university studies because of it; others were finally able to leave their 8-hour-a-day job. Iâ€™ve received countless thank-you messages.Thank you so much. Iâ€™m truly grateful to every one of you, and Iâ€™ll keep doing my best to provide analyses worthy of you.  SubscribeSome snippets from everyday chatâ€¦Substack has challenged me in several ways, too. I had to learn how to tailor my thoughts and analyses as optimally as possible to the needs of roughly two thousand subscribers, and to communicate them clearly and in a structured way.That took time on my partâ€”and patience on your partâ€”since Iâ€™m inexperienced when it comes to services like this. But I think weâ€™re on the right track. Thank you to those of you who believed in me.We called the February top; we called the geopolitical shiftsâ€”much of which is already included in the official presidential NSS report; we called the March bull trap, the April crash and the bottom, as well as the window-of-risk intervals.This market isnâ€™t easy. Itâ€™s full of manipulation and fraud, and it contains many non-trivial risks that matter for investors and for people who think in one-year horizons.Many of you have been constantly asking me not to stop after a year. In fact, at the beginning I was planning for 1â€“1.5 years, because of my other commitments.This isnâ€™t my full-time jobâ€”and it wonâ€™t be. Iâ€™ve also begun studies in national security, so my time is limited.However, as Iâ€™ve already told many of you, Iâ€™ll say it here as well: for the foreseeable futureâ€”through Augustâ€”I can continue providing the service in the usual format. From September onward, weâ€™ll see. Several of you have said youâ€™d be willing to subscribe even if it were only for weekly analyses. Ultimately my time will decide, but that is workable.It will depend on external circumstances when I switch to weekly-only analyses, because I donâ€™t want to overcommit myself. But I will let you know in good time.Next year I will implement the one-time subscription fee increase I promised, to â‚¬50, and after that there will be no further increases. Naturally, this affects only new subscribers (just like the switch to pricing in euros).SubscribeAnd now I wish every one of you a happy, successful, and productive new yearâ€”with this beautiful piece of music. And donâ€™t forget the old saying: as you sow, so shall you reap! :)~AP.S.: Here you can find some of the testimonials from the subscribersâ€¦  From Almaâ€™s subscriber chatAlmaYOUR TESTIMONIALS25 repliesStochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

Market analysisAppendix for today's intraday postRangebounding, spot decay, liquidity, insider speculationMar 13, 20254144ShareProloge:Todayâ€™s intraday post - algo predicts oscillating regime, eased negativ driftGeopolitical context - borning US-Russia-ME alliance, its conditions, shift in the geopolitical landscapeRecent weekly post - geopolitics interaction with the market In my todayâ€™s premarket post, there were four main statements:1) Local gamma is low, even negative, and the theoretically derived mechanical flows favor for further gamma decay as time passes2) Realized volatility is bid, implied vol is relatively underperformed during the spot decay, and so liquidity is low3) We are just right at the JHEQX collar current long put strike, in a net positive speed environment into EOM, thus MMs are long vanna4) Despite the geopolitical uncertainities, heavy bearishness, gov shutdown concerns, and growth scare, we see fixed strike skew for both SPX and VIX kinda stagnant and even shorter into the quarterly OpEx (and lower than it was on this Monday), absolutely crushed into EOM, and below its Monday lvl into this Friday expo, along with positive SPX/LTY correlation (good news are good news, bad news are bad news) Nowâ€¦ this is a significant discrepancy hereâ€¦ Subscribe The whole narrative behind the spot decay was to protect the market from a violent volatility squeeze and to gradually lower the market under relatively low volatility conditions. Thatâ€™s why I called it an "oscillation with negative drift." Volatility underperformed, and the grind up of the vol complex was slow enough to keep the spot/vol beta sticky. With this approach, insiders were able, on one hand, to buy out opposing positions from certain sectors like tech and commodities; on the other hand, they managed to drive prices lower in the tech sector to make it more attractive to Middle Eastern investors around Q3; and thirdly, through the negative wealth effect, they will force the Fed into implementing QE, while not letting bears to fully capitalize on the bear-side.  Iâ€™ve written extensively about this since the February OpEx, and by now you understand it. However, this level is not yet enough to sufficiently slow down growth. I mention this because itâ€™s important to understand that last yearâ€™s rally was entirely one long, protracted short squeeze through the derivatives marketâ€”I posted a lot about that last year. A deeper level is needed, and this fake liquidityâ€”upon which last yearâ€™s and this yearâ€™s all-time highs were builtâ€”must be washed out, because it is unstable. In the upcoming future geopolitical structure and alliance systems, the US needs stable growth, not one based on manias and bubbles.They have to solve it this year. (This is why I called to hit â€˜24 April lows) The problem is that by the time the spot reached the JPM long put strike and fell to 5532 (from which we went long gaining 100+ points in recent days), liquidity simply dried up because everyone ended up on the same side of the trade. And without liquidity, the market canâ€™t function as it should. The VIX got stuck at a high 26â€“27 level while the market was moving downward. Already on Tuesday, I saw signs of falling volatility in my stochvol models; also the HMM predicted a regime shift, and then this trend became visibly apparent both in the SPX and in the VIX vol smirk, as I mentioned premarket.  Additionally, L/S performance shows improvement in semis and AI, and the synthetic negative gamma supply is also decreasing, with the VIX significantly underperforming since Mondayâ€” as its drop was 2 vol points larger than what the SPX moves would have implied. However, we are in a situation of significant negative gamma, and if the vol of vol rises again and a vol crush occurs, then in the Mag7-8â€”which has a historically elevated put skewâ€”there is squeeze risk. This, in turn, would lead to a spot up/vol up scenario in the indexâ€¦ again.What can be done? Well, if Citadel, BlackRock, JPM, Goldman, and the other â€˜highly respectedâ€™ leaders get together to resolve this situation, they could have their quant teams switch their algorithms to mean reversion trading after buying in at a smaller size at Tuesdayâ€™s 5528 level, thereby providing the market with some liquidity. This wouldnâ€™t create upside momentum, but it would compress the intraday range, filling the market with liquidity, which naturally suppresses volatility. At the same time, the market is simply oscillating (as my model predicted after yesterdayâ€™s close, posted today premarket), and it can just as easily catch both bears and bulls off guard. Range-bound trading is Wall Streetâ€™s favorite toyâ€”we saw it back in 2022, and itâ€™s the same game now.Now here comes the twist! The JPM collar position is a very large one, with the short call strike at 6165 and a long put debit spread at 5565/4700 (with market makers taking the opposite side). Essentially, until the expiry at the end of March, this position fundamentally determines the vanna and speed exposure for the mechanical flows. As long as the market oscillates above the long put strike and volatility comes down, the market makersâ€™ long vanna effect produces a weak supportive flow for the market. However, letâ€™s not forget that the JPM long put strike represents a significant short gamma for the market makers. At that point, both the speed profile and the vanna profile reverse.Pay close attention: If the market falls from above toward the 5565 market maker short gamma strike, then due to the long vanna effect, market makers will have shorter vega, which naturally increases volatility.But below the strike, this reverses: if the market continues to fall toward the market makersâ€™ 4700 long gamma strike, then they will have longer vega due to the short vanna, which naturally decreases volatility. Now, as long as volatility remains sticky at elevated levels above the short gamma strike, the vanna effect is supportive below the collar strike, since high volatility results in a shorter delta in a negative speed negative vanna environment. Why? Because vanna is nearly zero where gamma is at its lowest. Therefore, when the spot approaches the short gamma strike from above, as volatility rises and dealers acquire longer delta positions, the vanna effect weakens, eventually becomes zero, and then reverses below the strike. However, all positions can be bridged on a weekly or even intraday basis. By this, I mean that if volatility does not rise but rather falls around the short gamma strike, then the spot can break through the strike and close below itâ€”and furthermore, from that point on, decreasing volatility, combined with the negative vanna effect, will push the spot lower and lower, along with the positive charm flow, toward the other end of the speed profile at the 4700 strike. But according to the code, the braking effect can already be felt around 5114.24. At those levels, the algorithms generate significant liquidity, culminating in a slow grind of spot down/vol down. Note, that my model isnâ€™t saying that the negative drift has suddenly become zero, but rather that itâ€™s now very small (written today). In other words, the downward trend is still there, but weâ€™re seeing strong oscillations that push volatility down, gradually guiding momentum across the JPM long put strike.(Thatâ€™s why many people mistakenly believe that the JPM short gamma strike has any pinning effectâ€”but this is a misconception.) Therefore, my current tactic is a short vol trade, as I written premarket, without any directional take. We need to watch where we stand relative to the collar strike. With this, the insiders achieve three things: 1) they fill the market with liquidity while 2) driving the spot down to a deep level that triggers QE and encourages buying by Russian and Middle Eastern investors, and 3) when they close the collar at the end of March, and it is ITM, the buyback flow induces supportive flow without an elevated spot/vol beta. This scenario is important to consider, which is why I continuously emphasize that we proceed day by day here and closely monitor the volatility cycles. In an environment like this, do not get married to either side. Thatâ€™s a golden rule! Itâ€™s all about the volatility trade as I keep sayingâ€¦Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.41 Likesâˆ™4 Restacks4144SharePreviousNext

# April's performance review

April's performance reviewFor all Subscribers...May 14, 2025318ShareDear Subscribers,Recently I received some criticism about the macro content from last April. I admit this topic is very complex and hard to understand, but letâ€™s not forget: the primary purpose of this Substack is to teach tape analysis, and macro processes are a key part of that game.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.SubscribeYou have to understand that â€œin the short run, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, it is a weighing machine,â€ as Benjamin Graham taught usâ€”and Aprilâ€™s weakness was the weighing machine, not the voting one. Once that â€˜weighing machineâ€™ has been turned on, it has restructured the market and set it on a new path. To monitor and interpret news, data, and policy shifts in the future, you need to understand the story behind the curtain that volatility cycles are telling. Not to mention that in such a high-volatility environmentâ€”when weâ€™re literally in the tails, as we saw over the past few weeksâ€”usual mechanical and structural flows simply donâ€™t work. Instead, I explained the dynamics that did matter.The events will show up on the tape one way or another, but to understand why the market reacts in a certain, seemingly irrational way, youâ€™ve got to grasp the real meaning behind those events. If you remember Trumpâ€™s speeches back in February and Marchâ€”and the marketâ€™s unpredictable swingsâ€”you know exactly what I mean. Iâ€™ve basically decoded all of that for you, and my goal was to walk you through how I arrived at those conclusions.The market is ultimately about valuing things at its core. If you grasp this, youâ€™ll see that volatility cycles always need to have a narrativeâ€”otherwise theyâ€™re neither manageable nor sustainable. Thatâ€™s why the story matters.(And Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t launch the Substack during a dull bull-market rally, but in a year when the global economic landscape is literally being repolarized.)A good analyst needs to be able to switch between approaches and pinpoint the key driver behind volatility cycles. I recognized in time that it was the macro and geo environment and front-ran the events effectively. Now that the weighing machine has reset the market regimeâ€”forcing it onto a new pathâ€”and the volatility market has adapted accordingly, we can return to microstructures, because the story is finally unfolding and the context is taking shape. This is how cycles work. One day youâ€™ll get it.This may seem strange way of approach, but it produced results. And please allow me to analyze things the way I think they should be analyzed!  Since many people got lost in the information, I made a quick review of Aprilâ€™s performance in terms of momentum. I also posted this on Twitterâ€”here you can see it:â€œWas it perfect? -Not at all. But at least, it was realâ€ Somebody also sent me a PDF. He scanned all my posts since March, checked for consistencies and inconsistencies, and compared my posts to the actual realized events. He/they estimated my April hit rate around 91%, and my trade signals hit rate around 80-82%â€¦ in a historically high vol environmentâ€¦Here you can read it. I think it is a good summary and review. Please donâ€™t criticize me without truly reviewing what I actually wrote.Thank you for your understanding and support.I remain your quant,~AStochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

Thank you for your continued attention and support. My (self-)reflection of the passed year can be read here. (Thank you for the nice comments and private mails) At the beginning of January, I published a very important article in which I describe the nature of the approaching crisis, the characteristics of the AI/tech bubble and the warning signs of its impending burst, along with a few key timing considerations and hedging ideasâ€”placing all of this in the context of a globally shifting geopolitical and worldâ€‘economic landscape. This bubble has been building for more than six years, and its groundwork was laid eleven years ago.

Please read the article and share it.

Educational postsLiquidity structure | Let's put speed profile into contextAlmaÂ·Jan 7During the 2021 GameStop gamma squeeze, the retail crowd discovered the options market and the hedging activity of market makers. The newly discovered â€œlow â€“ the idea that options positioning can directly impact the price of the underlying asset â€“ went through multiple, almost conspiratorial misinterpretations. On the back of this, a lot of furus jumped into building gamma/delta etc. data-providing services, operating on the old â€œsell shovels during a gold rushâ€ principle.Read full storyThis article follows my earlier tradingâ€‘focused educational posts, where I introduced the fundamentals of intraday trading My basic trading principles Pt. 1 - Strategies, basic risk managementAlmaÂ·July 2, 2025Read full storythen explained the mathematical pitfalls ("the â€œCasinoâ€) and what the true path to longâ€‘term growth and wealth building looks like (through my own personal example) My trading principles Pt. 2 - The Wall Street Casino and My StoryAlmaÂ·September 20, 2025Read full storyprovided a guide to my intraday posts A Guide to Reading My Daily PostsAlmaÂ·November 11, 2025Read full storyintroduced the short realized volatility strategy Statistical-arbitrage: Mean Reversion TradingAlmaÂ·October 24, 2025Read full storyand explained the meaning and operating principle of the sentiment proxy I use for market analysis The "Bessent put" - SPX/yields correlation; (Hidden QE)AlmaÂ·December 19, 2025Read full storyNext, I will place the options Greeks into this same framework, and I will continue to develop my work on momentum trading.

Free Insights | Market ReportsBoard of Peace, Greenland, Hidden Left-tail and Kurtosis | Geopolitical Developments [FREE]Jan 20, 20263722ShareEverything Iâ€™ve been saying since the winter of 2024â€“2025 about geopolitics and the global economy is playing out right in front of you. I wasnâ€™t wrong. I called it ahead of time.Board of PeaceThis week in Davos, Donald Trumpâ€™s next diplomatic bombshell is set to be unveiled: the â€˜UN 2.0â€™ aka the â€œBoard of Peaceâ€, whichâ€”according to the U.S. plans, incidentallyâ€”would in effect be intended to replace the UN. The American act unfolding before our eyes is preparing the ground for a far bigger collapse of the known geopolitical architecture than the one it is supposedly being created to manage. The Chairman position is endowed with such broad and virtually unlimited powers that modern democratic institutional systems offer hardly any precedent for itâ€”while history offers plenty. These are absolutist arrangements masquerading as constitutional: formal institutions (a Board, voting) exist, yet real power (vetoes, appointments, succession) is concentrated in the hands of a single individual, without any checks and balances whatsoever.The charter states, on the one hand, that the organization is not authorized to intervene unilaterally within the territory of a member state, and that member states may voluntarily withdraw. Yet a hegemonic trap is hidden here, because a hegemonic power has countless tools to coerce a state into joining the political structure it createdâ€”or, once it has joined, to ensure no one feels like leavingâ€”or even to force ideological pivots on its partners (as in the present case, where the new national security strategy expects a Christianâ€‘nationalist turn from Europe as well).I wrote many times last year about the importance of Christianâ€‘nationalist ideology.It is no accident that Russia has indicated it received the invitation and would like to hold talks about it with its American partners. Nor is it an accident that the UAE has already accepted the invitation. Donâ€™t you have some â€œholy alliance 2.0â€ and â€œYalta conference 2.0â€ flashbacks? I talked a looot about them last year. Everything what I said, is happeningâ€¦ Geopolitics, tech, context for 2025AlmaÂ·March 2, 2025Read full storyIt is hardly surprising that a number of Western political leaders have voiced fundamental reservations, mainly on the grounds that such an alternative organization would undermine the UNâ€™s legitimacy and functioning. However the UNâ€™s effectiveness is very much undermined by the UN itself, And here we must immediately add that the UN member states could make the existing organization more effective as wellâ€”if that were truly the aim, and if they did not measure effectiveness by the success of enforcing their own corrupt interests.If Russia becomes ideologically palatable (a Christianâ€‘conservative narrative) and is willing to cooperate with American leadership, then it may receive concessions (for example, on Ukraine). Ukraineâ€™s future may thus, unfortunately, also become a function of such a behindâ€‘theâ€‘scenes bargain. Intelligence sources are obviously watching closely how open Putin is to participating in an alternative world order. SubscribeWhat is the purpose of all this?Well, personally, having studied the American collective psyche, I have found that Americaâ€”unlike the Eastern worldâ€”is not imperial in disposition (not even at the level of ordinary people). The U.S. has typically been accused of imperialism for decades by the Russians, North Koreans, Chinese, and other authoritarian regimes, following the principle: â€œaccuse your opponent of what you yourself are actually doing.â€America thinks in terms of a global republic: countries are sovereign, decisions are made in a senate, and power ambitionsâ€”as well as initiatives that harm the global common goodâ€”are restrained. Thus, if a state is unwilling to compromise, it is compelled. This really is only one step away from dictatorship, but the essential difference lies in the underlying mindset: while the West thinks in terms of a republic, the East truly thinks in terms of an empire. It is no accident that in America, since 1776, the â€œUnited Statesâ€ system has never been broken and never transformed into an empireâ€”whereas in Europe and Asia, wars driven by imperial ambitions have been continuous over these 250 years. This is crucial to keep in mind, because in the long run it is the underlying ideology that determines the trajectory. Always. That is why I am not afraid of Americaâ€™s intentionsâ€”even if Europe, shaped by its own grim historical memories, is frightened by this Board of Peace idea.The goal is for America to forge a Western world built on unified guidelines against Chinese ambitions. As I already wrote last year, Russia wants to free itself from Chinaâ€™s shackles and rejoin the West, regaining the former Soviet geopolitical sphere of influence. Neither the Arab world, nor America, nor Europe, nor Russia wants a Chinese superpower. Unity can bleed out Chinaâ€™s greatâ€‘power position. It is no accident that China, in this situation, is once again offering to â€œhelpâ€ Europeâ€”just as I predicted for you last April.The other problem they want to solve is the dismantling of crossâ€‘border global capitalist networks. These are dangerous for nationâ€‘states, because a significant share of financial flows is directed into the pockets of a few bigâ€‘capital owners, draining national economies. The only problem is that this is impossible within a capitalist economic systemâ€”because what is happening is precisely the point of capitalism. That requires a new economic system, which I have written about before. Preparations are underway, and Europe will oppose this to its last breath, because most of its leaders are corrupt and beholden to globalist bigâ€‘capital interests. The Board of Peace plan is the root for the Holy Alliance 2.0 that will result a new Yalta Conference to take Russia in and defeat China. This is the plan. SubscribeGreenlandTrump was already openly interested in buying Greenland in 2019, but the Danish government rejected it thenâ€”as it does nowâ€”so Trump will impose a 10% supplementary tariff from February 1 on products from several allied European countries (e.g., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland). From June 1 this would be raised to 25%, and it would be lifted only in the event of an agreement on Greenlandâ€™s â€œfull purchase by the United States.â€The reason is that China and Russia also have designs on Greenland, and Denmark is not capable of defending the island. According to some of my sources, it has been slowly ceded into the hands of Eastern powers for the simple reason of corruption. Think about the chinese Artic Silk Road or the russian Northern Sea Route. And Greenland is extremely important from a militaryâ€‘strategic standpoint (radio stations, air defense, missileâ€‘launch sites, observation posts, intelligence, etc.). In 2025, U.S. military counterintelligence operatives secretly mapped Greenlandâ€™s critical infrastructureâ€”ports, airports, military basesâ€”without the Danish governmentâ€™s knowledge. Danish officials fear that the incident is part of broader American plans to acquire Greenland, even by force.The only problem is that in a Westâ€“East war Greenland really is a key strategic point, and on NATOâ€™s behalf the United States must secure it and use it militarily in order to succeed against Eastern hegemonic ambitions.Then why does the EU resist? Written aboveâ€¦I think China will exploit an escalating U.S.â€“EU confrontation to make moves toward Taiwan if EU leaders accept Chinaâ€™s economic assistance. China, leveraging the psychological pressure on Europe that stems from Europeâ€™s historical traumas, is presenting itself to the EU as an alternative to the United States. (As I said last year: in times of crisis, the left drifts toward the far left, and the right drifts toward the far right. We call the far left communism and the far right nationalism.) If Europe falls for the trap, China gains a massive advantage against America.At present, the crisis is unfolding in the geopolitical arena and in the ideological dimension. And it will not end until the world order is transformed. The challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5Read full storyMarketsFrom a market perspective, this means Europe can sell equities and U.S. Treasuries (possibly together with China) to exert pressure on Trump. This will not happen overnight, but it is entirely something to expect ahead of February OpEx if the tensions between the U.S. and the EU cannot be eased through diplomacy. The process, at a â€œwarning shotâ€ level, is already underway. But if it truly kicks off, we will once again witness a 20%+ blackâ€‘swan event, filling the May 9 of 2025 gap that is the key structural support of the whole rally and never been tested. Market already started to price in the new regime: gold is up, defense is up, and Japanese sovereign yields are up. That signals elevated long-term geopolitical risk, higher fiscal and term premia in sovereign duration (JGB yields), and a less reliable â€œcheap yenâ€ backstop as BoJ normalization collides with fiscal politics, persistentâ€”and even risingâ€”inflation concerns, and a shift toward a â€œclosed,â€ nationalist, government-driven economic regime.This rhymes with the preâ€“World War II era. The market is literally repricing this shift in world order right in front of your eyes. SubscribeFinancing the bubbleIn the meantime, Bessent also opened his mouth, thanks God, and he said everything I wrote in my earlyâ€‘January article.Bessent said openly that what is needed is a Fed Chair who can work wellâ€”especially with the vice chair responsible for regulationâ€”on further financial deregulation. This is not merely a personnel question; it is creditâ€‘supply policy. If banksâ€™ capital constraints/requirements are loosened, lending capacity increases, and it becomes easier to finance the capex boom (AI data centers, industry).Bessent also highlighted that the market did not panic; in fact, yields down/equities up and the MOVE Index is at a multiâ€‘year low. This means the â€œcleanupâ€ forced on the Fed could ultimately lead to looser financial conditions (at least in the short term). That is typically riskâ€‘on.Bessent also argues that Trumpâ€™s economic policy is trade plus tax plus deregulation. The â€œOne Big Beautiful Billâ€ (OBBBA) became law on July 4, and among other things it includes â€œno tax on tips/overtime/social securityâ€ elements. Full expensing/accelerated depreciation and new expensing mechanisms (bonus depreciation, â€œqualified production property,â€ etc.) reduce the afterâ€‘tax cost of investment, so logically they turbocharge investment appetiteâ€”exactly where the AI boom is capexâ€‘intensive. Deregulation, meanwhile, unlocks roughly $2.5 trillion of additional bank lending capacity. This is the key to financing the bubble, because if big tech and its supply chain undertake data center/AI capex, corporate free cash flow (FCF) may deteriorate in the short termâ€”so the system can only â€œabsorbâ€ it if credit is cheap and abundant (bank loans, bonds, private credit, structured products).The final point I want to stress is that, according to Bessent, nominal GDP could even run at 7â€“8% while being â€œnoninflationary/disinflationary,â€ like the productivity boom of the 1990s. In other words: if you can persuade people that a high GDP print is not inflation, then the Fed doesnâ€™t have to hit the brakes, the bond market wonâ€™t demand as large an inflation premium, and the equity market will buy the longâ€‘duration story (AI, growth). But here comes the reality check: the BEAâ€™s Q3 2025 GDP is indeed very strongâ€”4.3% annualized real growth, which is a fact. At the same time, a number of analysts have pointed out from the GDP reports that inflationary pressure in the quarter did not necessarily ease (e.g., GDP price index / PCE dynamics).So, with the â€œ1990sâ€ analogy, Bessent is trying to bring the bond market and Fed expectations into line with the growth program.Bessentâ€™s story is a conditional chain. If any condition breaks, stress arrives suddenly. If inflation comes back (tariff passâ€‘through, wages/energy, services), then the â€œdisinflationary boomâ€ narrative breaks; the bond market demands a higher term premium, which pushes yields up, which makes financing more expensive. And if banks are unwilling to lend more (NPLs/delinquencies, spread widening, recession fears), then the $2.5T â€œcapacityâ€ remains on paper.That is a very fat, hidden leftâ€‘tail risk with an even higher kurtosis embedded in the market.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

Free Insights | Market ReportsEarning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026[FREE]Jan 23, 20263023ShareGeo context including â€œBoard of Peaceâ€: Board of Peace, Greenland, Hidden Left-tail and Kurtosis | Geopolitical Developments [FREE]AlmaÂ·Jan 20Read full storyAI/tech boom, overvaluation, bubble-burst triggers, geopolitical landscape, description of the coming crisis: The challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5Read full storySubscribeBank of Japan & USDJPYIâ€™ve already discussed the significance of the BoJ rate decision in my weekly post. This is what I wrote:â€œFor BoJ, most coverage points to a hold at 0.75% (after the December hike to 0.75%). As said in the yearly post, I expect a pause in rate hikes during the first half of the year. Which, if markets are leaning that way too, reduces the chance of a rates shockâ€¦ but it heightens the sensitivity to any sign the BoJ is drifting away from that patience. So now, carry conditions can persist.However, if communication pushes investors to price earlier tightening, US momentum stock - selling can be expected (Japanese investors have accumulated dollars and bought US equities and bonds, often unhedged, in part because the yen depreciated for years and Japanese policy rates were extremely low).It depends on how much the gov worries of the near-term import inflation.â€Japanâ€™s government bond market saw a sharp sell-off: yields pushed above multi-decade highs, while the yen weakened to multi-month lows.  The driver is rising fiscal uncertaintyâ€”and, with it, a higher risk premium. This is reminiscent of the UK in 2022, when a fiscal-credibility shock sent gilt yields soaring and impaired financial stability, prompting the Bank of England to launch a temporary, targeted longâ€‘gilt purchase programme to restore â€œorderly market conditionsâ€.Fitch has argued that the deficits are manageable, but it also highlighted that Japanâ€™s debt ratio remains the highest among advanced economiesâ€”on the order of >230% of GDP.In this context, the Ministry of Financeâ€™s efforts to support the yen may prove insufficient. As an IMF publication notes:So if the market starts to price in fiscal dominance (i.e., monetary policy being forced to safeguard the governmentâ€™s financing capacity), then 1) part of the bond-market premium can migrate into FX, and 2) the yen becomes the balance-sheet â€œcollateralâ€ through which the system reprices. The rise in yields therefore is no longer a â€œrewardâ€ (carry), but a â€œpenaltyâ€ (risk premium).But then how can the yen be holding up against the USD?Because the USâ€“EU diplomatic dispute has given de-dollarization fresh momentum, and the yen is weakening primarily against the euro instead:This is crucial from a carry-trade perspective, because Japan effectively has only two choices: 1) accept higher interest rates and risk a debt crisis, or 2) cap yieldsâ€”in which case the yen depreciates. However, the â€œsell Americaâ€ momentum may, in the short run, mask yen weakness versus the dollar, yet it embeds asymmetric tail risk, as the yen could start trading like a â€œfiscal stress / riskâ€‘offâ€ currency. The carry trade has therefore deteriorated in quality: for the same tail risk, there is less potential upside in USD/JPY if the USD is falling on its own.Looking at inflation passâ€‘through and potential policy responses, my view remains that yen weakness may still be with us through the first half of 2026. Later, however, the yen could strengthen back toward ~140 against the dollarâ€”especially if the USâ€“EU diplomatic dispute is resolved. The main reason is the rise in imported inflation driven by the weak yen, which the central bank will ultimately have to manage.   But the most important reason is the weakness of the dollar, ultimately leading to USDâ€‘carry deleveraging.SPX & NDXThe geopolitical realignmentâ€”and with it, de-dollarizationâ€”continues.Since 1 January, the SPX is up 0.8% in USD terms, but it is down 0.11% in EUR terms and down 9.75% when measured in gold.The same pattern holds for the NDX: it is up 1.24% in USD terms, but only up 0.26% in EUR terms, and it is down 9.72% when measured in gold.Retail trading volumes in January 2026 are running ~40% above the average January level over 2020â€“2025, in both cash equities and options. This flow is on the supportive side and, in the short run, shows up as persistent negative speed exposure on the marketâ€‘maker side. (Most of the activity is concentrated in stocks linked to rare earths, the drone industry, nuclear energy, and cryptoâ€‘related themes.) This implies that traders are typically short OTM puts and long OTM callsâ€”creating synthetic leverage via dealer hedging flows on the bid, while reflexively suppressing downside volatility. That, in turn, triggers local hedge unwinds and vol compression, and therefore additional volâ€‘control buyback flows and positive rebalancing flows. The effect is likely to growâ€”especially given that Nasdaq has recently approved Monday and Wednesday singleâ€‘stock option expirations (in the mould of 0DTE options), which should further lift retail volumes by improving flexibility. It is therefore unsurprising that the most heavily shorted stocks have outperformed in recent weeks. Another important aspect is that volâ€‘ofâ€‘vol is also being soldâ€”both synthetically and directlyâ€”via deep OTM put selling, VIX call selling, institutional buyback programmes (Citadel, BlackRock), and outflows from moneyâ€‘market funds. This applies both to the bond market (â€œBessent putâ€) and to the equity market.This is reinforced by moneyâ€‘market funds (MMFs), whichâ€”as I flagged over the course of last yearâ€”have begun to shrink their asset base: Since the start of the year, roughly a 1.35% outflow (in dollar terms) has occurred, which is the largest timeâ€‘adjusted outflow since April 2025. This suggests that parked cash has started to rotate back into riskier assets in early 2026. The liquid reserves accumulated in MMFs therefore represent potential buying firepower for equity and bond markets over the coming weeks.The net effect is that the kurtosis of the expected return distribution is being compressed: the left tail is still present, but its magnitude has been materially reduced.In other words, due to intervention by large market participants, the market can only experience managed, temporary drawdowns; they are not allowing it to collapse. In the short run, an illusion of stability is being maintained; over the longer run, however, risks are accumulating. More on that later. For now, the objective is to keep frontâ€‘end volatility and volâ€‘ofâ€‘vol in check, because both the market and the broader geopolitical backdrop are on the cusp of a regime shift. The market is being protected at all costs from a larger crash that would deteriorate economic statistics and sentiment.Yearâ€‘toâ€‘date, RTY has outperformed NDX by roughly 7.3%â€”meaning that on every day of 2026 so far, small caps have outperformed megaâ€‘cap technology: This behaviour is also evident in the broader SPX. Since 29 October, a modest rotation out of technology has been visible:There has also been significant rotation within the top 100 blueâ€‘chip names since 29 October: However, the rotation has primarily been led by tech: At the same time, market breadth has genuinely been improving since 29 October:In other words, it is no longer just a handful of megaâ€‘caps pulling the indices higher; an increasing number of sectors are contributing to todayâ€™s index level. I warned about this trend last year, and this broadening helps damp volatilityâ€”and the effect is only strengthening:This rotation is, on the one hand, a consolidation phase for tech, and on the other hand, an early signal of pressure coming from the European Union and China. With volatility being capped, the bullâ€“bear spread is running at roughly three times its longâ€‘run average. This reflects strong optimism, and abundant retail liquidity can provide nearâ€‘term supportâ€”especially during minor pullbacks. At the same time, as equity participation broadens, attention shifts toward sector rotation and fundamentals rather than purely index moves, whichâ€”as I notedâ€”are being managed in order to keep the distribution under control against external shocks.Yields curvesFor most of 2025, the US yield curve was extremely flat and inverted; in early 2026 it appears to have reached a technical â€œsupportâ€ level. Over recent weeks, asset managers have begun buying longerâ€‘dated bonds and selling shorterâ€‘dated paperâ€”effectively putting on curve steepeners.At the same time, CTA strategies in rates remain positioned short: globally they are net sellers of bond futures, especially in the long end, while partially hedging via some buying in the front end. This suggests that systematic models are still leaning toward higher yieldsâ€”consistent with a reflation narrative. The current USâ€“EU standoff adds fuel to that dynamic, although the pressure is likely to be concentrated more in the technology sector. As I also wrote last December, I continue to view deep OTM put hedges in the US rates market as a desirable position.Since New Yearâ€™s the 2sâ€“5s spread has widened by 12.27%:The 2sâ€“10s yield spread has widened by 11.67%: The 2sâ€“30s spread has widened by 12.25%:In all three cases, current levels are sitting between their 10â€‘year and 30â€‘year moving averages.Overall, a normalization process is starting to take shapeâ€”at least, that is the intended path. The market remains sensitive to political and inflation headlines, but overall liquidity has not deteriorated materially. The continuous presence of large institutional liquidity providers (e.g., Citadel Securities) provides a buffer effect: they have continued to supply bid/offer liquidity even through volatile episodes. Pricing in rates derivatives (e.g., interest rate swaps, FRAs) indicates that investors are pricing roughly one Fed rate cut in 2026, which is expected to stabilize the long end of the curve. There have also been strong inflows into global bond funds at the start of the year. Approximately ~$16.8 billion has gone into bond ETFs globally, with notable allocations into intermediateâ€‘maturity government bond ETFs (roughly a 2â€“3 standardâ€‘deviation inflow versus typical levels) and into municipal bond funds. A meaningful rotation is underway: money is flowing out of highâ€‘yield credit (â€“1.5 standard deviations), while flowing into investmentâ€‘grade bonds (+1.2 standard deviations). This points to a more cautious, qualityâ€‘tilted investor posture. CFTC data likewise show leveraged funds net short US long bonds, while having established some net long exposure on the short end.Meanwhile, asset managersâ€™ nearâ€‘record VIX short positioning suggests they are also looking for equity volatility to decline alongside bonds. Beyond indicating improved risk appetite, this implies an expectation of further upside in the near termâ€”driven by fiscal and monetary stimulusâ€”while inflation is not being treated as an immediate risk. That last point is critical.Gold and other metalsGold is up 85.85% since January 2025.The rally has been driven by three key forces: 1) An increasingly uncertain geopolitical backdrop and regime transition (e.g., concerns around Fed independence; USâ€“Iran tensions; USâ€“EU friction; USâ€“China conflict; etc.); 2) Monetary-policy expectations, as anticipated US rate cuts reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, and 3) central-bank demand and ETF inflows: central banks purchased a record amount of gold in 2025 (e.g., China has been accumulating gold reserves for 14 consecutive months), while physically backed gold ETFs saw $89bn of net inflows over the yearâ€”also a historical high. In addition, the worldâ€™s largest gold ETF, SPDR Gold Trust, increased its holdings to 1,073 tonnes by endâ€‘2025, the highest level in three years.Back in the summer-autumn of last year, I wrote that in my view gold would move above $5,000â€“$5,200 by this yearâ€‘endâ€”which is not an encouraging signal for the macro environment.No fear of recessionHere I want to draw attention to an important process. Letâ€™s look at gold relative to copper. In the chart below, you can see the copperâ€‘toâ€‘gold ratio versus US 10â€‘year Treasury yields (cyan) since January 2025:First, as context: among industrial metals, copper and related metals strengthened in early 2026, in parallel with analysts upgrading global growth expectations. Over the past few weeks, CTAs have also built long positions in both copper and gold (copper longs are around the 80th percentile). Meanwhile, $4.5bn flowed into commodity ETFs in a single week. Within that, roughly $3.7bn went into preciousâ€‘metals ETFs (primarily gold, e.g., GLD), $0.5bn into energyâ€‘commodity ETFs (an unusually strong inflowâ€”more than 3 standard deviations), and meaningful inflows also hit industrialâ€‘metals ETFs (roughly a 4.9â€‘sigma anomaly).This matters because copper is a faithful proxy for global demand in the real economyâ€”it is a foundational â€œcivilization metal.â€ Across many analyses, copper prices (especially YoY changes) tend to coâ€‘move with manufacturing activity (e.g., ISM Manufacturing PMI). Gold, by contrast, is a safe havenâ€”a monetary hedge. It typically performs well when risk aversion rises and/or when the appeal of yieldâ€‘bearing alternatives declines. Importantly, this downtrend in the ratio did not begin recently; it began in 2021: Since October 2021, the ratio has fallen 55.02%â€”meaning gold has significantly outperformed copperâ€”while 10â€‘year yields are up by 158.68%, i.e., the discount rate / financing hurdle has moved dramatically higher.Over this period, the rise in yields was driven primarily by an increase in the term premium, fueled by quantitative tightening, heavier Treasury issuance, and elevated uncertaintyâ€”while the growth/demand side was deteriorating. That is a classic stagflationary signal.However, I would add that throughout this periodâ€”until early 2025â€”the SPX/yields correlation showed a net negative tendency:In practice, that meant the market was primarily labeling inflation as the key risk, rather than slowing growth. During the 2022 bear market, sentiment tilted somewhat toward the view that â€œtoo much tighteningâ€ could push the economy into recession, but by 2023 the market once again consistently treated inflation as the dominant risk. From Q3 2024, the assessment began shifting again toward the view that slowing growth was becoming a larger risk than inflation. Even so, over the past five years the correlation has been net negative overallâ€”suggesting the longâ€‘run risk remains inflation, while the market still views a slowdown as manageable. That is a reasonable stance: with rates still relatively high, markets can expect additional monetary support if neededâ€”but conditionally, that support should not undermine the softâ€‘landing narrative.This is internally consistent. If long yields are not being driven by a â€œgrowth scare,â€ but instead by term premium and supply factors, then the classic riskâ€‘off hedge function is impaired. Moreover, a persistently negative SPX/yield correlation can itself contribute to a higher term premium.Gold, meanwhile, is being driven primarily by geopolitics, rather than functioning purely as an inflation hedge. Centralâ€‘bank gold demand in 2024 accounted for more than 20% of global demand, and after 2022 geopolitical factors gained prominence; the traditional realâ€‘yield correlation has also broken down.Copper has not collapsed either: while the classic China fixedâ€‘asset investment impulse has slowed, electrification (EVs, grids, renewables, data centers / AI) has introduced a new secular demand engine. Put simply, gold continues to outperform copper.That points to a powerful supplyâ€‘side and fragmentation shock.Tariffs, sanctions, logistical rerouting, and rising compliance costs slow and raise the cost of moving inputs. Supply chains are being reâ€‘engineered (friendâ€‘shoring, as I wrote about last year), and the required transport/inventory buffers are increasing. In effect, geopolitics is importing supplyâ€‘chain inflation into the global system: trade frictions and delays impair global throughput and can ultimately lead to developments (capex deferrals, tighter financing conditions, higher uncertainty) that damage global industrial demand.Over the same period, the copperâ€‘toâ€‘SPX ratio fell by roughly 24%. Taken together, these signals clearly suggest growing tension between financial asset prices and the physical cycle. In my view, equity cash flows have been â€œpainted prettierâ€ than underlying physical demand: organic growth is minimal, and financial results have been inflated through M&A accounting, buybacks, and accrual mechanicsâ€”artificially reducing the apparent degree of overvaluation, in a creditâ€‘saturated system that Wall Street is happy to believe.In the near term, this can still be managed via soâ€‘called â€œsynthetic QEâ€ (like MBS demand by the GSEs, tariffâ€‘related stimulus checks, OBBBA fiscal stimulus, which could lift GDP growth by roughly 1%), tax rebates, caps on creditâ€‘card interest rates, prescriptionâ€‘drug price reforms, and Bessentâ€™s longâ€‘term yield managementâ€”and later via monetary easing under a new Fed chair. But this embeds longâ€‘run inflation risk and a creditâ€‘crisis risk into the systemâ€”on a much broader scale than twenty years ago.On the nature and drivers of the approaching crisis (including the AI/tech bubble, inflation dynamics, geopolitics, future regulation, and demographic aspects), I wrote in detail in the post below: The challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5Read full storyCTAs, Vol Control, Risk Parity Funds, InvestorsVolatility suppression embeds additional asymmetric risk. A volatilitÃ¡s szupressziÃ³jÃ¡ra vÃ¡laszul a CTA modellek 2026 elejÃ©n Ã¶sszessÃ©gÃ©ben long pozÃ­ciÃ³ban vannak a rÃ©szvÃ©nyekben globÃ¡lis szinten, ugyanakkor a piaci esÃ©sre valÃ³ Ã©rzÃ©kenysÃ©gÃ¼k nÅ‘tt.In response to volatility suppression, CTA models are, on balance, long equities globally in early 2026, but their sensitivity to a downside move has increased. The major US equity indices are only about 1â€“2% away from the level at which CTAs, under their short-term trading rules, would begin to turn into net sellers. For now, they were still net buyers in energy last week (on the back of higher oil prices) and sellers in bonds. It is important to highlight the asymmetric risk embedded in CTA positioning. According to their model projections, if indices move sideways for a week, they would exert only modest selling pressure, and they would be incremental buyers (about 0.27x times smaller trade) if markets rise. By contrast, a one-week move lower could generate roughly 6.65x time bigger size of selling (than initially). Over longer horizons the asymmetry becomes even more pronounced. On a one-month horizon, a sideways market could imply around 2.7x bigger size of selling (than initially), while a 5% decline could trigger approximately 13.20x size more of potential selling, versus only about 0.07x smaller size of buying in a similarly sized rally. In other words, CTA models add only limited upside demand, but they de-risk much more aggressively on the downside.Volatility-control funds (which adjust portfolio weights as a function of realised volatility) are currently running extremely high equity exposure, around 95â€“98%. With realised volatility as low as it is, these models are at or near maximum equity weights. As a result, there is limited capacity for further incremental equity buying from this cohort, but if volatility spikes they will automatically become sellers as well, and in an asymmetric way.Risk-parity funds are similarly near 75â€“80% exposure, which is historically very overweight, while having slightly reduced commodity exposure. This indicates that multi-asset systematic strategies are positioned optimistically, taking advantage of the quieter tape, but in a volatility shock many could be forced to sell simultaneously.Investor sentiment has not improved. Funds are diversifying, scaling down exposure to US assets, and participating primarily via short-term, speculative momentum strategies. The Cboe COR3M Index is at a two-year low, reflecting elevated rotation. Index options have become relatively expensive versus single-stock options, as demand for hedges has increased across the 1â€“5 year horizon.Corporate buyback windowAs we approach the end of January 2026, an important technical development is the reopening of corporate share-repurchase windows. Due to earnings season, many companies have been in blackout since mid-December and were unable to repurchase shares. That buyback quiet period expires in late January/early February, so corporate repurchases should re-accelerate from February, providing an additional demand backstop and further compressing the kurtosis of the return distribution.Historically, February has been negative in 48.38% of observations. Strong January inflows often lose momentum, and February brings a correction before the market regains strength. This time, however, the USâ€“EU conflict also increases risk into February OpEx.Earnings seasonCorporate earnings in 2025 consistently beat expectations, and in early 2026 fundamentals, together with expected fiscal and monetary support, should continue to provide a stable backstop in the near term. In my piece titled The challenges of 2026, I laid out explicitly where bubble-like features are showing up in earnings reports (through Nvidia and TSMC).Wall Street expects 2025 Q4 to be the 10th consecutive quarter of positive year-on-year EPS growth for the index. The FactSet consensus is looking for around +8.2% EPS growth in Q4 (y/y). It is important to emphasize that the market entered earnings season with cautious expectations. Into year-end 2025, profit forecasts were restrained, partly due to tariff-war uncertainty and tough base effects. As a result, the bar is low, and early reporters have already cleared it: so far roughly 79% of S&P companies have beaten EPS consensus (slightly above the 5- and 10-year averages), although the magnitude of the beats is smaller than usual (about 5.8% versus a typical 7â€“8%), which can be interpreted as an early sign of tightening financing conditions.Over recent weeks, analyst estimates have edged up in some sectors (for example, consumer discretionary) and been revised down in others (energy, healthcare). Overall there has been no major negative surprise; a profit recession looks avoidable in the near term, and the market appears prepared for this outcome and is not treating it as an immediate bubble-burst signal.That said, profit growth has accelerated in cyclical sectors (industrials, materials, utilities, financials), while mega-cap tech is already comping a high base and is finding incremental growth harder. In parallel, profit declines are likely in four sectors (for example, consumer staples and energy) versus last year, driven by high bases (oil-sector windfall profits in 2022â€“23) and margin pressure.It is also important that profit growth is improving in sectors more directly tied to the real economy, and this is not yet reflected in index weights: indices remain heavily concentrated in a few mega-cap tech names. Improving results in the periphery can therefore create larger relative moves. For example, if an industrial conglomerate reports unexpectedly strong numbers, the stock can deliver meaningful relative outperformance even if it has limited impact on the index because its weight is small. In other words, the largest moves may come from sectors with small index weight but improving profit trends, which would further reinforce rotation. Final thoughtsThe Trump administration has placed excessive emphasis on equity indices as a headline indicator of success, with a weaker dollar also contributing meaningfully to returns. If the market were to correct 10â€“15% during 2026, Trumpâ€™s political capital could evaporate quickly; todayâ€™s tailwind of rising 401(k) balances could easily become a political vulnerability. Maintaining the equity boom through the midterms therefore becomes a key objective at almost any price. The real risk is that these trends are artificially sustained for too long, making any eventual correction even more painful, and ultimately crystallising longer-term credit non-payment risk as investments fail to earn an adequate return.In the short run, the machine still works: fiscal stimulus and the prospect of monetary stimulus, together with buyback flows, all reduce tail risk and provide support to the market, while injecting additional liquidity into sectors to sustain growth for as long as possible. Problems begin when the toolkit is exhausted, and they run out of ammo.Into February OpEx, tail risk remains elevated because of the ongoing USâ€“EU conflict. I think there is a meaningful probability of managed sell-offs designed to damp volatility, similar to last February. That would imply slower position reductions and high-volume intraday buy-the-dip speculation, aimed at reducing instability while systemic tail risk is still present. At the same time, liquidity is being channelled into the structural pivot areas I have laid out in my weekly posts, preventing the broader structure from failing. It is not only the algorithms; the narrative and retail speculators are also, for now, working in Trumpâ€™s favour.I still view the accumulation of risk, both geopolitically and from a market-valuation perspective, as becoming truly visible into the second quarter (the late-spring to summer window). That remains my window-of-risk target.It is important not to forget that, as the charts also show, geopolitical realignment and the search for the right narrative are what are currently driving markets and economies. This will end in a crisis, followed by a tokenized, AI-driven new economy.We are standing at the threshold of a historic regime change.

Market analysis[free] SPX, Gold, BTC - A quick overview of the recent momentum and sentimentNov 18, 202522ShareHere I explained my window of risk call that I updated as policy is erratic nowadays, while sentiment is overoptimistic and not pricing in any bad news. Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update AlmaÂ·October 29, 2025Read full storyNow I want to quick review how it is going now for the SPX, gold and Bitcoinâ€¦ SubscribeI wonâ€™t cover my precise quantitative outputs here (in terms of levels, dynamics and sentiment) like I do behind the paywall, but I do cover the overall momentums as they currently lookâ€¦SPX As long as the market cannot build structure above the â€œupside pivotâ€ marked area, the tendency remains risky and cautious. I personally does not expect it to happen in the near term as you know, market has seriously shaken. Earler I warned my followers on Twitter saying that going against seasonality is a big source of liquidity.SPX is currently testing the November lows that is a significant pivot sentiment wise, and both the weekly and intraday positioning derived pivots are coincidencing with this zone. Very important to watch it through the week. The downside target is the marked quite wide range. Last weekly and this current weekly positioning both points into that range. A 10% decline below 6200 would be healthy but I see low chance to happen due to the current motivations behind policy to cover any weaknesses. I think, more volatility is coming after VIX expo. Providing a potential buy-the-dip opportunity for an EOY rebound on a december hawkish Fed cut.But I will be careful with any of this. Simply because my warning earlier.Gold As long as Gold is building structure below the upside area marked with a yellow line, the odds are shifting towards a temporal retest of the lows as people are locking profit from gold. It can happen two ways: in time or in terms of spot.The first one is more likely as it looks now especially as dollar/gold correlation is also on a pivotal tendency againâ€¦ I suspect an uptrend in their beta similar to 2021-2022, simply due to stagflation, central bank demand and geo concerns. If the dollar is ripping because the world is blowing up (policy accident, geopolitics, hard-landing panic) and real yields drop on rate-cut expectations, then you can absolutely get USD up and gold up together. If the admin is more concerned about yields, while stagflation materializes, we can see stronger dollar, capping gold (not necessary pressing it lower). I suspect stronger dollar and rangebounding gold in the near-term as the most likely scenario. Second likeliest scenario is a gold retesting the marked upside then going below the pivot, while dollar starts to strenghten, then gold reverses back up. This would be a more natural trend, also would cause the beta to retest down a bit making higher low before going more up.Anyway, I expect gold reaching 5k in the next year. BTC In July I posted this chart of Bitcoin: saying: â€œIt is trading at ~119,940.88 currently. Here are the levels Iâ€™m watching:122,056.68 is our major local resistance, but the true â€œline in the sandâ€ is 107,500.61 - this levels will prove us if BTC spot wants a melt up towards 143,519.88 before taking its gains back, or if it has already topped.My main target zone where Iâ€™m interested to buy into BTC is 56,183.44 - 67,250.15Participants expect weakness starting to be realized during August, and expect volatility after October.â€ Well, BTC failed to build a structure above 122k, and indeed broke 107k after October just as expected. This call is still intact, I donâ€™t see any reason to change it. I donâ€™t play speculating game on cryptos, I only make really long-term trades with them. For now, the two consecutive red weekly candles below the pivot of 107k look prove the downtrend. I think, we wil see a bounce back toward 107k and also 112-115k area, to retest the liquidity. That will be the actual pivotal pattern. (Similar for Ethereum with 3700/6900, 3200 and 2880/3000 areas)All-in-allFor now, market has shaken, and trust in this economy and admin became really fragile for multiple reasons: erratic policy, insufficient foregn policy with big leaders, USA inner conflicts (like SCOTUS), stagflation, shutdown, missing autumn datas, too much mechanical flows-driven aggressive market trends, blindfolded Fed, corruption, shifting world-order, AI bubble (with growing technical and supply-chain concerns, and heavily concentrated market), and looming debt crisis that the leaders are not seem to be willing to handle properly. Big money is scaling out. Current market is for momentum traders, not for investors. This is crucial. A lot of processes have started to happen that look irreversible and market is not prepared as it has been complacent and numb on the adminâ€™s promises lately. Now, it will start to reprice the risk over the next several months.

Market analysisGDP Release - Weekly post (22-26/Dec) [FREE post]Sentiment breakdown, GDP, Positioning breakdownDec 20, 2025274ShareOn Dec 24, market closes at 1PM ET, and will be closed on Dec 25Liquidity vacuumLast week, the retest of the gap is happened as expected, however, as you will see below, the market is not convinced that the gap was actuall filled with liquidity. On Thursday and Friday and market formed too more gaps after some higher volatility days, that makes the zone still fragile. The weekly POC also falls at 6810, just above the gap. The positioning shows that market is still concerned about this liquidity vacuum downward, and it expects that to persist.It read like the market wants either â€œgo upâ€ on being optimistic, above 6900 now, or go down and retest the past weeks lows and build a â€œbasisâ€ there, before going up.GDP releaseMarket expects more local liquidity upward than downward, but there will be a significant sentiment-check on Tuesday: GDPThis is effectively the first official â€œcleanâ€ read on Q3 (BEA is doing two estimates instead of the usual three). The updated estimate (standing in for a typical third estimate) is scheduled for Jan 22, 2026.The common calendar consensus reading right now clusters around 3.2%, but Fed GDPNow has been running above thatâ€”about 3.5% (as of Dec 16), implying modest upside risk versus consensus. The SPX/yields beta for pricing in inflation scare:This print will decide if market believes in room for more upside this week, or if it frontrunned itself. If the data is weak, the market sees more Fed easing ahead. If the data comes strong that will erase the concerns about the future easing cycle. And market needs that liquidity. It will eventually get that, no doubt about it, the only question is: when.With a lot of datas missing, the odds are high that prints will be manipulated into a supportive print.If the print is â€œpositive supply-side shockâ€-ish (GDP up/prices down), that is the risk-on scenario.If the print is â€œnegative demand-side shockâ€-ish (GDP down/prices down), that is also benign, however the initial reaction will be pessimistic. If the print is â€œpositive demand-side shockâ€-ish (GDP up/prices up), the initial reaction will also be pessimistic as market re-prices its Fed cut odds. But if data is not hot, it also can get a benign read on the short-run too.If the print is â€œnegative supply-side shockâ€-ish (GDP down/prices up),thatâ€™s the stagflationary print, and market will not be happy at all.Based on my modelling, the most likely outcome is between the first and third outcome: GDP modestly above consensus, with the inflation measures (GDP price index/PCE prices in the GDP report) in-line to slightly softer than expected. Skewed towards â€œin-lineâ€, that is still price increase. So, given that it will get a â€œdatas were not fully collectedâ€ foggy narrative, this can take some time to digest positively.SubscribeBelow, I cover what the positioning says and what are the key levels derived from the volatility structure. And I will explain, step-by-step the conclusionsâ€¦ WEEKLY POSITIONING BREAKDOWNWEEKLY POSTHere is the weekly positioning:Speed profile The net speed profile is flat-to-positive. Customers are selling vol into both direction, but slightly more RV is being sold to the upside. The centroid of the profile is at 6798.90,but in order to get a proper stabilisation SPX needs to get above 6915.75, with a magnet clustering around 6928.60To the downside, the pivot is at 6688.88, with the most supportive cluster at 6670.34With the RV profile, market leaves a bit more room for downside moves, but aims to swallow it if it happens, while to the upside, it is net stabilization.Letâ€™s see, what the forward vol positioning tells usâ€¦Positioning derivativesNet gamma is positve, locally too, meaning customers expect compressed daily moves overall. Net color is negative until Thursday, then flips to positive into Friday, meaning, they leave a little room for momentum into midweek, but expect the spot to stabilize into Friday. Local magnets will come into effect.Net zomma is positive until Thursday, meaning participants expect missvalued volatility to take advange of, as IV/RV relationship is expected to remain inverse, but it flips to negative onto Friday, increasing the IV/RV correlation.Net vega is positive, butNet veta is negative and steeply so, meaning after an initial low IV state, they expect vol to increase into Friday. Net vomma is positive over the week, meaning, any volatility move is expected to be capped into both ways. The more vol is being bid, the more MMs will sell, and vice versa. Ultima profile says there is significantly more vomma effect to vol down moves, but it shifts into Friday. Net vanna is positive and very strong this week. So market expects shorter spot/vol beta to normalize, with supportive vol decay and suppressive vol expansion. Letâ€™s try to put it together, what it tells usâ€¦First, I want to say that the profile is beautifully consistent. Let me explain step by step.Both gamma decay and vega decay are priced to be negative this week. This means both realized volatility and implied volatility are expected to increase over the week. However, the slope is different and this is consistent with the zomma exposure!IV expansion is expected to be concave with a firm support from the lower levels due to higher downside ultima exposure (more vomma to buyback if vol decreases, creating a path of the least resistance to the upside for vol), however veta decay weakens as time passes and upside ultima increases creating a growing concavity to the upside. The RV expansion is way more flat, because 1) long zomma counterbalances the decay, and 2) the short downside speed also creates heavy upside concavity for RV. By modelling this, RV is rather expected to net rangebound with a flat positive drift, than increase convexly. And into Friday the RV is expected to be dumped but with a higher low. If it plays out, this means, IV also will be slightly down on Friday. What does it mean for SPX spot?Well, the IV/spot relationship is expected to be inverse due the to very heavy long vanna exposure. This means, the long skew traders expect to hit downside levels on the implied vol increase (see the vol projected ranges below). The RV expectation adds a bit more shade howeverâ€¦The speed profile is net flat-to-positive, this means a net very weak negative correlation between spot and RV, so this means, the net drift of the spot is expected to be rather net down until Friday. However, this is only a net expectation and very flat, almost zero correlation. The story depends on, which side of the centroid the spot is trading at.Because downside speed is sold and upside speed is bought by MMs, this says, that the market expects a rangebound around the centroid with a net flat-to-negative drift until Friday. But this rangebound is expected to widen from day to day, until it stabilizes into Friday potentially above the centroid. But this path is conditional: if spot is above the centroid into Friday in average, then the vol crush is expected to stabilize the spot upward. If it trades below the centroid on a net basis into Friday, then the stabilization is expected to be downward. Now, given the low (almost zero) asymmetry of the profile, and the increased correlation of IV/RV along with long vanna on Friday, it hints that the former scenario is the primal bet, with a flat weekly close. Do not be married to it! Positioning can drastically change, macro can surprise. Use this only as a base idea what the market is expecting.The key idea is that the market primarly expects a slight positive drift in vol, and long skew trades to catch a bid on uncertainity over the week, then stabilize the sentiment into Friday. Vomma rangesThe ranges for SPX that I can derive from vomma selling expectations, are at6691.65 - 6737.50 to the downside, and6910.23 - 6946.04 to the upside.These are the zones that are expected to be produced by a vol increase and decrease where vomma steps in the hardest. You can see the asymmetric expectations to the downside caused by the ultima and vanna exposures.Also note, that the lower bound of the upside zone is just 5 pts under the upside pivot derived from the speed profile, where the market aready expects stabilization.While, the downside pivot is 3 pts below the lower bound of the dowside zone. Farther from the point where the market expects downside stabilization.So given this asymmetrical expectation for the vomma to kick in, it kinda hints me that market has a â€œhidden reversion expectationâ€ in the worst case too, if everything remains under control.Fixed strike skew is bid, especially on the tails by 66.69%However the whole smirk moved downwards by ~32.07% The bid comes from heavy selling of 22-delta puts and even more 22-delta calls relative to the tail contracts. This also projects me a sentiment where participants have no real fear, but they expect to capitalize on long skew and short vomma trades during the week. All in all, the market expects undervaluedvalued uncertainity potential for the next week, that is reinforced by a negative drift in spot until mid-week, then we can see some contructive flows, but sentiment will remain moderated, skewed towards pessimism.For the GDP, the market sentiment is â€œbad news is good newsâ€/â€good news is bad newsâ€. The sentiment flips based on how fast the data print can be turned into a bullish narrative on this week.For Monday, the risk appetite expected to be moderate but slightly positive. For Tuesday, the GDP release can cause some increased uncertainity first. This release will be effectively the first official clean read on Q3. Market needs some time to digest it. I expect a moderated net negative sentiment, lowering risk appetit, and market needs to revaluate the datas one the longer horizont. The â€œinflation scareâ€ vs. â€œgrowth scareâ€ narrative may take some time to kick in about the datas.For Wednesday, we can expect a dull day, with some swing position close ahead of the holiday. Risk appetite expected to remain moderate. For Friday, we can expect the weekly sentiment to be stabilized.

Market analysisIntraday post 19/march (+Fed)...quick macroMar 19, 2025162ShareI canâ€™t stress this enoughâ€”whether in my daily chat (in my first messages) or in my postsâ€”that the U.S. is struggling with stagflation. Trump has set out to eradicate this stagflation from the economy, even if only on paper. Last year was about two things: 1) Trump winning the election, and 2) figuring out when the Fed would cut rates. Thatâ€™s why we saw the Julyâ€“August vol squeeze, to give some room for the Fed. As I emphasized, the cut was a â€œhawkish cut,â€ purely for populist reasons, andâ€”as anticipatedâ€”inflationary pressure continued to rise. I kept showing this on Twitter, shorted the market, and voilÃ , I was right againâ€¦Inflation did not moderate last year; in fact, it only grew. The economy needs room so that the U.S. can achieve sustained, long-term, stable growth. Thatâ€™s what you need to understand. This is why everything you see happening is happening: the negative wealth effect. Leverage flush. Wall Street is reporting huge losses (even the renowned Renaissance), while dealer desks (like Citadelâ€™s MM department) are booking profits. Theyâ€™ll cover their losses during tax-harvesting time.Now, listen,Over the past three years, the Fed has been allowing a set amount of its bond holdings to mature without reinvesting the proceeds. This â€œrunoffâ€ drains reserves from the banking systemâ€”a process the Fed has used to gradually tighten monetary policy. In 2019, a similar reduction led to strains in overnight funding markets, forcing the Fed to reverse course.Now, with the looming need for Congress to raise the debt ceiling, thereâ€™s a risk that Treasury actions (like drawing down its general account to conserve cash) will distort reserve levels. If the Treasuryâ€™s cash is rebuilt quickly once the debt ceiling is extended, it could cause a rapid exit of reserves from the system. To avoid a potential liquidity crunch in the overnight markets (the â€œaltimeterâ€ of the financial system), Fed officials are considering a tactical pause or slowdown in the balance-sheet runoff. This would help ensure that reserves arenâ€™t drained too quickly during a period when market signals might be misleading because of the interplay between the Fedâ€™s operations and debt ceiling dynamics. This pause wouldnâ€™t indicate a change in the Fedâ€™s overall goal of reducing its balance sheetâ€”it would simply delay the process until after the debt ceiling issues are resolved and Treasury cash balances stabilize.The SPX/long-term yields correlation has risen 62.3 basis points since last Monday and is currently trending at 54%. So this doesnâ€™t just mean that good news is good news; it also means no news is good news, because investors see a pause in the runoff as reducing the risk of an abrupt reserve drain. In the short term, thatâ€™s supportive. Remember, based on the faked CPI and other reports, inflationary pressure appears to have eased.Letâ€™s see what the market is telling usâ€¦ INTRADAYKeep my weekly post in mindâ€¦Strong futs overnight.The models show that since last Wednesday, the market has been oscillating intraday (just as I predicted it would) with a slight neutral-to-positive drift and relatively low variance. However, the ADF test still does not indicate any tendency toward a mean-reverting phase in the broader momentum. That said, the reversion model shows a 97.62% probability of reversion, but I want to emphasize again that, on a longer timeframe, the marketâ€™s momentum does not suggest a shift toward a mean-reverting phase. So this signal is more of a supportive signal rather than a strictly reversion one. Intraday, however, the oscillation is very strong. According to the model, as long as the SPX can hold the 5523.5 level, the positive drift remains intact.As I mentioned, funds are in mean reversion mode during RTH (regular trading hours). This means that whatever they do during the Asian and London sessions, they reverse during RTH, causing oscillations.Yesterday, however, the VIX options technically expired, and the beta hedging trades in ES put pressure on the index, as the VIX was pinned around 21.Letâ€™s take a look at the skew. Here, you can see todayâ€™s 5-delta put â€“ 5-delta call range: If we measure the skew slope for the 25d Put/ATM, 25d Call/ATM, and 25d Put/25d Call segments, we can observe that since yesterday, the slope has decreased slightly. However, compared to one week ago, there is a 3.51% increase in the longer skew. But if we look at the ATM vs. call and ATM vs put segments, we see that itâ€™s not demand for puts that has grown; rather, demand for calls has fallen.Compared to the values from February 24, the slope has decreased by 8.84%, which indicates a shorter skewâ€”and indeed, it stems from the put side.The VIX is quite similar enough.At the same time, weâ€™re seeing a moderate increase on the tail-put side (and on tail-calls as well!). Itâ€™s not huge, but we need to pay attention because it affects the vol profileâ€™s sensitivity. I code 5611.96 as our main pivot level, and 5523.77 (very close to the 5523.5 my momentum model highlightedâ€”no coincidence!) as the point below which the trend turns decisively more bearish. That level should be taken very seriously today.Thereâ€™s also something else: looking at the Friday AM expiration vol profile, the model gives 5622.03 as todayâ€™s pivot. 10 pts above the intraday vol profile based pivot. And weâ€™re currently almost at their geometric midpoint (3 points below it). Not by coincidence. Itâ€™s a typical footprint of heavy algo trading.From the vol profileâ€™s perspective, 5567.27 is another crucial level for the bullsâ€”if puts donâ€™t catch a bid there, the trend wonâ€™t start rolling downhill. If they stay calm in that zone, put decay will be supportive.For upward momentum, 5698.85 is the key level per the vol profileâ€”itâ€™s a trend-reversal threshold. But watch 5656.83 carefully, to see if calls catch a bid. That will be your signal of how strong the upside could be.OptionsDepth chart: (Description is here)Coding zero vanna at 5608 (high vol needed for break through).From positioning perspective the move can be stabilizied by MM flow above 5711We have a MM long fly patter with 5600 in the middle. Short speed below, long speed above.In theory, we should see increased spot/vol beta below 5535.52, and decreased spot vol beta above 5659.26, and â€˜feelâ€™ the longer gamma effect.This setup favors for vol increase in theory and wider rangebound. Below 5613 the charm flows turn positive (putting dealers in longer delta in every 5 mins, forcing them to sell futs).Color (charm convexity) is negative, meaning, the gamma decay is on, during the session, and this favors for more volatility. Any deviation from this exposes the underlying customer flow.SubscribeSCRIPT INPUTS:SPX99.73%, 5749.414878376666, , 5715.62691588033, 95.4%, 5682.0375173133325, Risk level, 5660.072497606687, 68.2%, 5648.248370493001, 68.2%, 5580.869796508938, Risk level, 5569.247814893313, 95.4%, 5547.2827951866675, , 5513.4911928797255, 99.73%, 5479.905434123334ES=F99.73%, 5755.927536872077, , 5721.341744375597, 95.4%, 5686.963768436039, Risk level, 5664.48157992589, 68.2%, 5652.3767081709675, 68.2%, 5583.411640648245, Risk level, 5571.51842007411, 95.4%, 5549.036231563961, , 5514.446540632414, 99.73%, 5480.072463127923SPY99.73%, 575.0362195916605, , 571.5214278523413, 95.4%, 568.0281195614552, Risk level, 565.7434789516084, 68.2%, 564.5131944699493, 68.2%, 557.5049577349258, Risk level, 556.2965601108916, 95.4%, 554.0119195010448, , 550.4967175192262, 99.73%, 547.0038194708395VIX99.73%, 24.938991438492593, , 24.115652875377815, 95.4%, 23.319496100716023, Risk level, 22.791540620600863, 68.2%, 22.495179109687065, 68.2%, 20.87455348136205, Risk level, 20.608460905278044, 95.4%, 20.080505425162883, , 19.253737642695445, 99.73%, 18.461010087386313IWM99.73%, 209.65748207791071, , 208.03936902893426, 95.4%, 206.43374439588894, Risk level, 205.38280591154987, 68.2%, 204.8155330648956, 68.2%, 201.59169395747077, Risk level, 201.0372075161845, 95.4%, 199.98626903184544, , 198.36785155340257, 99.73%, 196.76253134982366QQQ99.73%, 489.6088161899683, , 485.82700867150174, 95.4%, 482.0744123674451, Risk level, 479.6181967213025, 68.2%, 478.2923747710553, 68.2%, 470.7577335057741, Risk level, 469.4618203685412, 95.4%, 467.00560472239863, , 463.22308451627606, 99.73%, 459.47120089987544NQ=F99.73%, 20108.010190567282, , 19954.61001256226, 95.4%, 19802.38009528364, Risk level, 19702.744684221172, 68.2%, 19648.970815865174, 68.2%, 19343.331331554, Risk level, 19290.755315778828, 95.4%, 19191.11990471636, , 19037.691545776295, 99.73%, 18885.489809432718NVDA99.73%, 123.44986157923175, , 121.42834488638991, 95.4%, 119.43993094220376, Risk level, 118.13269355453264, 68.2%, 117.41784900562926, 68.2%, 113.40731314953639, Risk level, 112.72730705581893, 95.4%, 111.4200696681478, , 109.39673292156769, 99.73%, 107.41013903111981AMZN99.73%, 201.731457287338, , 199.4911551058629, 95.4%, 197.27573230577838, Risk level, 195.82316596178993, 68.2%, 195.03514593039586, 68.2%, 190.57912346564285, Risk level, 189.81684868664757, 95.4%, 188.36428234265912, , 186.1230867571169, 99.73%, 183.9085573610995GOOG99.73%, 169.25619636815517, , 167.6015590057353, 95.4%, 165.96309726855023, Risk level, 164.88954696207904, 68.2%, 164.30829780868513, 68.2%, 161.0150299809983, Risk level, 160.4504493758116, 95.4%, 159.3768990693404, , 157.72175510732706, 99.73%, 156.08379996973545TSLA99.73%, 247.6089304677592, , 241.96998777386054, 95.4%, 236.45946401317647, Risk level, 232.8247379489825, 68.2%, 230.81741974884648, 68.2%, 219.66453682875593, Risk level, 217.795257168205, 95.4%, 214.16053110401103, , 208.5112884841305, 99.73%, 203.0110646494283TSM99.73%, 182.75515685140388, , 180.3328153080076, 95.4%, 177.9425808671082, Risk level, 176.37368109622778, 68.2%, 175.51979915206917, 68.2%, 170.7067581763026, Risk level, 169.88632866939722, 95.4%, 168.3174288985168, , 165.8936902204296, 99.73%, 163.50485291422112AMD99.73%, 109.08523400477256, , 107.6824059044494, 95.4%, 106.29761807050151, Risk level, 105.38885527592916, 68.2%, 104.89455025669267, 68.2%, 102.10668151953156, Risk level, 101.63114899653178, 95.4%, 100.72238620195942, , 99.31879859071132, 99.73%, 97.93477026768838Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.16 Likesâˆ™2 Restacks162SharePreviousNext

The right-tailedness is like 6.36% bigger than the left-tail below the centroid, so not a big difference, but it is there, and upside vomma is pretty much sold again (relative to downside vomma).The reason is the the 6493 gamma that is pretty magnetic during the session. These all takes me to the calculation that market bets on an ranging between the centroid and 6493 gamma, and a potential pin there if upside pivot is broken.Upside pivot is at 6486.85; from here the gamma of 6493 is magnetic. During the power hour it serves as a line in the sand in order to decide to pin to the upside or to the centroid. (margin of error of 6475) Only if call skew gets heavily bid by more than 20.83% (on a fix strike basis in the 30/22 delta calls), thats when this 6493 line can be broken, and then I code 6522.98 as max target. During the power hour it can pin, if call skew remains bid and spot hold 6511Downside pivot is 6462.61;this is a heavy line to break. Strong put skew bid is needed with an at least 82.30% increase in the 30/20 delta puts to break below this line. Then, 6412.44 is the downside target with margin of error of 6405. But again, the tailedness is very small on both sides, only right-tail is a bit bigger. The main bet is a choppy, premium burning upward grind to 6495. Futures seems to work better today, than options. If one smells presigns of reversions, 1-2DTE ITMs are prefered.OptionsDepth Heatmap (Description is here)(to sign up, use â€˜ODALMAâ€™ for 10% discount)Educational postsMy basic trading principlesAlmaÂ·July 2, 2025In this post I will examine the psychological aspects of trading.

I will also introduce a bet sizing mathematical model known as the Kelly criterion.Read full storySCRIPT INPUTS=== SPX closed at 6481.4 ===99.73%, 6571.284383595986,  , 6548.774734785565, 95.4%, 6526.342191797992, Risk level, 6511.691037271847,  68.2%, 6503.832276582746,  68.2%, 6458.889814672525, Risk level, 6451.108962728153, 95.4%, 6436.457808202007,  , 6413.947348976968, 99.73%, 6391.515616404014=== ES closed at 6485.25 ===99.73%, 6575.9295596901375,  , 6553.220458331422, 95.4%, 6530.589779845069, Risk level, 6515.809011615576,  68.2%, 6507.880405304037,  68.2%, 6462.540348443464, Risk level, 6454.690988384424, 95.4%, 6439.910220154931,  , 6417.200287668455, 99.73%, 6394.5704403098625=== SPY closed at 646.63 ===99.73%, 655.7126412612288,  , 653.4380357495749, 95.4%, 651.1713206306144, Risk level, 649.6908501050341,  68.2%, 648.8966875084001,  68.2%, 644.3553388780338, Risk level, 643.5691498949659, 95.4%, 642.0886793693855,  , 639.8139898501888, 99.73%, 637.5473587387712=== VIX closed at 14.85 ===99.73%, 16.638403568652606,  , 16.185128456515923, 95.4%, 15.744201784326304, Risk level, 15.452692002635928,  68.2%, 15.290565604229478,  68.2%, 14.395957887641739, Risk level, 14.247307997364071, 95.4%, 13.955798215673695,  , 13.501296388512024, 99.73%, 13.061596431347391=== IWM closed at 235.94 ===99.73%, 241.85615236142908,  , 240.37256397437537, 95.4%, 238.89807618071453, Risk level, 237.9337433458016,  68.2%, 237.41443109903364,  68.2%, 234.45629679307444, Risk level, 233.9462566541984, 95.4%, 232.98192381928547,  , 231.4981610016556, 99.73%, 230.0238476385709=== QQQ closed at 573.49 ===99.73%, 584.6324626824453,  , 581.8401788489243, 95.4%, 579.0612313412227, Risk level, 577.2450099239841,  68.2%, 576.2688830414825,  68.2%, 570.6975859753765, Risk level, 569.734990076016, 95.4%, 567.9187686587774,  , 565.1262876133808, 99.73%, 562.3475373175547=== NDX closed at 23565.85 ===99.73%, 24017.234370144313,  , 23904.12191832307, 95.4%, 23791.542185072158, Risk level, 23717.966532738632,  68.2%, 23678.42719443339,  68.2%, 23452.732421679935, Risk level, 23413.733467261365, 95.4%, 23340.15781492784,  , 23227.037598638297, 99.73%, 23114.465629855684=== NQ closed at 23542.0 ===99.73%, 23993.470600746783,  , 23880.33622409535, 95.4%, 23767.73530037339, Risk level, 23694.145592451667,  68.2%, 23654.598378357437,  68.2%, 23428.860483570465, Risk level, 23389.854407548333, 95.4%, 23316.26469962661,  , 23203.122538302858, 99.73%, 23090.529399253217=== NVDA closed at 181.6 ===99.73%, 190.46623648082,  , 188.23662739233902, 95.4%, 186.03311824041, Risk level, 184.58792169403634,  68.2%, 183.80319440221504,  68.2%, 179.3697458534787, Risk level, 178.61207830596365, 95.4%, 177.16688175958998,  , 174.93628056321404, 99.73%, 172.73376351918=== AMZN closed at 229.12 ===99.73%, 237.64588150155174,  , 235.50476573127466, 95.4%, 233.38294075077587, Risk level, 231.99322206602292,  68.2%, 231.24164716767126,  68.2%, 226.97852192483376, Risk level, 226.24677793397709, 95.4%, 224.85705924922414,  , 222.71538961920874, 99.73%, 220.59411849844827=== AAPL closed at 230.49 ===99.73%, 237.94943933472328,  , 236.07721401267165, 95.4%, 234.21971966736166, Risk level, 233.00383105580175,  68.2%, 232.34737611199785,  68.2%, 228.61753435349138, Risk level, 227.97616894419826, 95.4%, 226.76028033263836,  , 224.88768854520174, 99.73%, 223.03056066527674=== GOOG closed at 208.21 ===99.73%, 215.59692152808225,  , 213.742213429809, 95.4%, 211.9034607640411, Risk level, 210.6993925549637,  68.2%, 210.04861238694485,  68.2%, 206.35500632240306, Risk level, 205.7206074450363, 95.4%, 204.5165392359589,  , 202.66139496161577, 99.73%, 200.82307847191777=== TSLA closed at 349.6 ===99.73%, 368.50718062584616,  , 363.7496752710618, 95.4%, 359.05359031292306, Risk level, 355.9717198709102,  68.2%, 354.29526552495435,  68.2%, 344.8408108484292, Risk level, 343.22828012908985, 95.4%, 340.146409687077,  , 335.38630744175515, 99.73%, 330.6928193741539=== TSM closed at 239.29 ===99.73%, 249.13615844591587,  , 246.66233680855262, 95.4%, 244.21307922295793, Risk level, 242.60815539627365,  68.2%, 241.73900745899823,  68.2%, 236.8156677095888, Risk level, 235.97184460372634, 95.4%, 234.36692077704205,  , 231.89231689792186, 99.73%, 229.44384155408412=== AMD closed at 167.13 ===99.73%, 177.14431420588042,  , 174.62278959044903, 95.4%, 172.1371571029402, Risk level, 170.5048238873817,  68.2%, 169.61510270790862,  68.2%, 164.60738359315965, Risk level, 163.7551761126183, 95.4%, 162.1228428970598,  , 159.59962921217536, 99.73%, 157.11568579411957Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.8 Likes81SharePreviousNext

Market analysisIntraday post (28/feb)Feb 28, 20252722ShareCoded gamma for today expo:3D chart, my heatmap. OptionsDepth:Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Subscribe Coding zero vanna at 5914 (positive vanna convexity, vol has to calm down to break above this line), and downside vanna flip at 5795.65, here you should see vol up to break through this line (negative vanna convexity).Significant flip points from gamma perspective for intraday trading at 5890 and 5856As you can see on the chart, locally we are in a negative speed environment that is mechanically suppressive (as char nor a vol crush arenâ€™t supportive), but still accelerant to the upside towards the vanna flip with increase spot/vol beta, short-term gamma squeeze. I code 5854.77 as the pivot for that.We also have negative charm convexity = short color, meaning these low gammas will furter decrease into PM, making the profile more steep, adding to vol and suppressive flows into EoD. MMs have deltas to buyback, we will likely see that in the opening, but as time passes, long charm exposure will increase put deltas and MMs will sell, if spot cannot grind above 5934.48 before PMFrom mean reversion perspective, SPX is likely to forming a near-term bottom again: But as long as I donâ€™t see another new white dot, Iâ€™m not convinced about the strenght of the move more than a bounce. Code says, SPX should hold above 5953.38 to confirm upward momentum. â€œSpot decayâ€I spent some time explaining in the chat this week since Sunday, my call about a hedged spot decay, where downside vol cannot really catch up in avg, and the market slowly grinding lower into a supportive March OpEx. I explained this call in the Tuesday morning post, with link to the chat explaination. I already saw this kind of pattern in â€˜22 and also in â€˜23 too. What this means is that While the net trend points down, there is not enough intraday edge on the puts side bcs the trade is crowded. However the call side edge is better bcs of the underpriced odds. Personally while I still hold my puts I bought at 19th Wednesday close into March expo, I look for intraday call edge reversion trades and not building directional exposure until Q1. The expo will be covered on Sunday post. VIX call accumulationWe can see accumulation of VIX call spreads on both April and May expos.Now, you better know, that in itself it is not very telling, bcs it can be a simply rebalancing activity from some large portfolio. We could see similar like back in jan 17 last year. What we must do in this situation is to watch for sudden spikes in the prices of near-term VIX calls and SPX far tail puts (e.g. 5-10 deltas), like 1-week or 1-month calls, and also watch the trend if the VIX momentum is sticky at higher sigma lvls or not (my shared SD indicator can help with this), in order to catch actually tail-risk expectations. Here you can see the multi-expiry skew for both SPX and VIX into next week, March expo, April and May: Now, in itself these arenâ€™t quite telling. What we have to look for is the CHANGE in the pricing of these events like from post-NVDA ER, and 1 week ago vs current: What we see here is rather a slow kind of grind up in SPX tail puts, but we can see the spike in tail calls into next Friday. Lets look at VIX into March 17 Vix expo: Now, here we see some significant increase during the week in the 42C and 60C IVs (like ~30 bps), not as much as what we would expect, but its there. Note, that we donâ€™t see this kind of change into April or May VIX expos: This tells me more lika a â€˜sticky high VIXâ€™ environment that is hedges due to , than fear of left-tail event. Similar with SPX, into March OpEx, 5-10 delta puts at 5450 - 5220 are rather decreased relative to post-NVDA ER than increased, while right wing is bid: Same with April and May: So, these higher order activities are rather noise for now than actual left-tail concerns. This, along with my reversion signals puts me like more the call side than the put side. Mean reversionThe probability for a mean reversion up is pretty much elevated. Both of my models now give green signals, the more sensitive one too: Model says that for the short-term upward momentum, spot needs to conquer 5953.38For the longer-term, the lvl is 6119.32 Note, that this is a negative skewed probability distirbution. And this tells higher probability for up than down from here, temporary. Negative event have lower probability, but higher impact.I hedge the left-tail, while going for intraday call edge.

# Iran-risk and oil prices

Free Insights | Market ReportsIran-risk and oil pricesTiming is lostFeb 24, 2026242ShareTiming is lost Regarding military intervention in Iran, Trump has missed the window of opportunity. Both British and Arab intelligence agencies are unanimously attempting to dissuade him from any kind of military operation, particularly during Ramadan (a window lasting approximately until the March OpEx), as such an action would directly ignite a jihad in the region and lead to an Arab Spring 2.0.Such an operation would precipitate a localized humanitarian disaster, massively drive up oil prices (especially since Arab oil refineries and shadow fleets would also sustain damage), and further exacerbate supply chain disruptions, all of which would collectively deepen Western stagflation.This, in turn, would provide China with an opportunity to enforce a blockade along the First Island Chain, exerting further pressure on Trump (which would bolster the Democratsâ€™ position domestically). The crack spread (long gasoil/short Brent) shows bid on March and May contract:The spread is above its 95th percentile since November correction, signaling steep backwardation.And this comes from gasoil, that means refinery margin, distillate premium.Meanwhile, in contrast to this, the Brent front-month versus 6-month spread has been trending lower since June last year. This is a serious divergenceâ€¦On the one hand, this signals the risk of supply disruptions; on the other hand, it indicates that the regime continues to adapt.Brent shows massive call demand for May 26 expiry:So does gasoil:The geopolitical and global economic risks of this would be immense, as it would drastically degrade the negotiating leverage of the United States on a global scale. SubscribeThe risk of any military operationLet me outline how the assessment of such a strike is conducted. The success of the intervention hinges on whether the Washington-backed son of the Shah is capable of forging the opposition into a unified front and sufficiently undermining the Ayatollahâ€™s grip on power. However, intelligence agencies cannot gather exact data on this; they can only rely on probabilities. This was also the case in 1979, when U.S. intelligence deceived itself by seeing only what it wanted to see in the data. The U.S. military is unequivocally robust enough to execute the operation, but the focal point of the assessment is whether it would actually yield the expected results or merely further destabilize the environment. Unfortunately, Trump waited too long here; the regime has adapted, closed ranks even more tightly after the initial tremors, and prepared for American intervention. So timing is lost. Iran is buying time through negotiation to get fully prepared after RamadanTo comprehend Middle Eastern conflicts, one must understand that their roots are fundamentally ideological, rather than diplomatic or economic. The latter are merely secondary, sometimes entirely fabricated pretexts. Factions are held together precisely by these ideologies; if an individual emerges who can take the helm and authentically represent the most widely accepted ideology, they can forge the group into a cohesive bloc. Therefore, the critical question intelligence agencies must currently evaluate is whether the oppositionâ€™s faith in Persian culture and the unifying authority of the Shah are at least as strong as the fear of the Islamic religion and the believersâ€™ loyalty to their group. (This is especially pertinent given that the plunge of the rial is due to an artificial dollar shortage engineered by the U.S. In such scenarios, autocratic regimes typically adopt a victimhood posture.) Without this ideological counterbalance, the regime cannot be overthrown, and a Venezuela-style operation would only result in a power vacuum and civil war.It is crucial to understand that the driving force behind the idea of an American intervention is Israel, which seeks to guarantee its own security through the preemptive dismantling of Iranâ€™s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, because the roots of power are inherently ideological, regime change is essential for long-term success. An American strike would undoubtedly cause destabilization, but it could subsequently foster stronger cohesion within the system. This probability is remarkably high, as this is exactly what is currently observable. The loyalty of the security forces remains steadfast; moreover, they have proven their allegiance to the regime. Preparations for succession are proceeding without conflict, there is no internal strife within the regime stemming from the crisis, official communication is disciplined and consistent (showing no signs of panic or disarray), and the repressive apparatus shows no signs of fatigue, continuing to employ lethal force and internet blackouts. Furthermore, the opposition demographic driving the intent for regime change is highly fragmented. Acceptance of the Shahâ€™s son is by no means unanimous, either among the diaspora or Iranians living at home, and the protest coalition is heavily fractured and episodic, failing to genuinely aggregate into a unified bloc. Finally, Iran is actively preparing for an American military operation (efforts include dispersing leadership and command-and-control centers over a broader area, maintaining heightened readiness in the Strait of Hormuz, burying tunnels in Isfahan, reinforcing the Pickaxe Mountain entrances near Natanz, and implementing â€œconcrete sarcophagusâ€-style coverings at Parchin, among other measures). As long as the aforementioned factors do not exhibit structural cracks, any form of external intervention will prove futile. The initial conditions were favorable, but Trump waited too long.

Market analysisJanuary OpEx week quant breakdown | Weekly post (12-16/Jan) - FREEJan 11, 2026182ShareLast weekly post upside target was hit. I kept warning to not be bearish on SCOTUS as nothing will happen, Trump has a plan B, that I broke down publicly in details. I expected optimism and constructive datas for the week with profit taking into Thursday and optimism back into Friday. It all happenedâ€¦Uncertainity and fear is growing. Mostly due to global risks and supply-chain issues from China. I warned you about it last year and before. A lot of stress will accumulate into spring. Things will start thenâ€¦I published a very important article in which I describe the nature of the approaching crisis, the characteristics of the AI/tech bubble and the warning signs of its impending burst, along with a few key timing considerations and hedging ideasâ€”placing all of this in the context of a globally shifting geopolitical and worldâ€‘economic landscape. This bubble has been building for more than six years, and its groundwork was laid eleven years ago (the post also contains Bitcoin, oil, TSM, NVDA, yields): Market analysisThe challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significantâ€”yet still underpricedâ€”risk in the market.Read full story(I added new sections to it)Please read the article carefully. I like short vol trades on the front-end but scaling into long straddles on the long-end. Also I like deep OTP TLT puts, and quarterly put flies to hedge the equity upside momentum trades. For now, the dice keep rolling and ppl still keep betting on the numbers even tho they know the dice are loaded and the game is rigged. Pain trade is up like a vaccum. First serious shake can be expected in Q2 (as I keep saying this since last summer). Until both side will be exhausted: bulls will not get enough momentum, bears will be lured in and humiliated by a rangebound with a net positive drift. Rotation at max. SubscribeLetâ€™s analyse the next weekly sentiment and betsâ€¦ WEEKLY POST (OPEX)Letâ€™s look at the january OpEx positioning: The speed profile is net negative, customers are selling realized volatility into both ways, but 1.27x more vol is sold to the downside than to the upside. So they expect more momentum up but not a squeeze, while betting on downside premium decay.The centroid of the profile, where the impact is balanced is at 6902.91 zone (with margin of error of 6859.01 if vol catches up). The profile favors for a wide rangebound with a net positive drift while downside is protected, I will scrutinize the bet and sentiment further. Letâ€™s see the spine of the positioning:Downside pivot is at 6835.10target is 6793.01 (the most supportive cluster)Upside pivot is at 7016.02with target of 7070.29 (stabilization is only above the pivot, target is magnetic is vol declines above the pivot).Letâ€™s look closer at the dealer exposure to decode the expectationsâ€¦ MM exposureThe profile is net short delta with long charm. That is almost hand in hand with a net negative speed profile.Net long gamma means the base case is short realized volatility, butNet short color pushes gamma negative into Thursday, so does the speed profile, also shifting the supportive cluster up towards the downside pivot. Net zomma is also positive lowering the IV/RV correlation. Until Wednesday, there is more upside zomma, providing a heavy protection against tail event, but after Wednesday it shifts, even a -5% IV suppression pushes the net gamma into negative territory. This is a trappy environment for both sides. Net vega is positive, meaning the base bet is short vol from the customer side, butNet veta is negative, pushing net vega down to negative into Thursday. Net vomma is positive with a very high exposure, with more ultima on downside vol. As I coded, even a 3-5% vol suppression shifts net vega into negative territory. So the path of the least resistance is upward for IV. Net vanna is negative (flip at 6800) and very heavy exposure especially to the downside, even on Friday. This is like having a short ratio call spread to the upside and a short ratio put spread to the downside with 1.3x more vol being sold to the downside from the customer side with a net bet of short vol long delta bet. Also, below you will see that skew is bid, and customers are net selling the skew, but this trade concentrates on assuming overpriced downside rather than any upside squeeze. By zomma, they express this mispricing, because it says that downside vanna grows after Wednesday, meaning the short skew trade is even heavier on the left-side of the smirk. However, the positioning also warns us that market expects risk into Thursday-Friday window, if vol declines too much (by ~3-5%) they will see it as complacency! They expect IV to rangebound with a flat-to-positive drift. Vomma projected rangeDeriving the expected volatility changes and projecting the spot movements it can cause, my calculation provide Downside zone of 6853.06 - 6889.41 Upside zone of 7011.15 - 7032.36 where the vol move can take the spot and it shifts to supportive from below and supportive above. This also means that market expects a reversion from the downside in the worst case, while doesnâ€™t expect upside stabilization either, but the net drift of the trend points up, through rangebound. Fix strike skew is increased by 46.79% at the tails due to tail hedges growing, while 22-delta skew increased by 46.53% mostly due to OTM call selling, while the whole smirk is down by net 4.04%  I think, that for now this is only a noise, as most of the tail skew bid is a result of spot up, and the previous 30-20 delta long puts slided below 10-deltas, and this is exactly what the market is shorting. SubscribeSentimentDeriving the sentiment, it tells me that market expects: the week to open hectic in order to provide room for short vol trades and upside moves, so the sentiment will converge towards moderate risk-taking, the short vol trade is confident;CPI release is expected to trap long vol traders (no direction bias), while optimistic stabilisation coming later on (so market will calm down later and remains optimistic), bad news are still good news and vice versa;For PPI release, Mr. Market expects short vol trades and optimism to peak, they donâ€™t fear PPI, supportive narrative is already prepared for both cases;For Thursday, the optimism remains but  traders are expected to start to take profit from their short vol/short skew trades, and the momentum cools down (not necessary reversion, but more vulnerable downside and end of the initial momentum);On Friday the mood is expected to be more serious and pragmatic opposite to the initial purely speculative vol trades, consolidation and risk-off is expected, but nothing bearishness, only a shift back from speculation into the basic protective stance, end of the weekly cycle. Letâ€™s look at the weekly sentiment shifting ranges that the vol market prices in: SPX:  7021.06 -  6911.50; vol based margin of error bounds:  7047.56,  6885.00ES:  7060.33 -  6949.67; vol based margin of error bounds:  7087.09,  6922.91SPY:  699.64 -  688.50; vol based margin of error bounds:  702.33,  685.81VIX:  15.98 -  13.00; vol based margin of error bounds:  16.70,  12.28IWM:  263.59 -  256.87; vol based margin of error bounds:  265.22,  255.24QQQ:  634.06 -  619.24; vol based margin of error bounds:  637.65,  615.65NDX:  26065.30 -  25467.22; vol based margin of error bounds:  26209.94,  25322.58NQ:  26240.71 -  25635.79; vol based margin of error bounds:  26387.01,  25489.49NVDA:  189.66 -  180.06; vol based margin of error bounds:  191.98,  177.74AMZN:  253.98 -  240.78; vol based margin of error bounds:  257.17,  237.59AAPL:  264.07 -  254.67; vol based margin of error bounds:  266.35,  252.39GOOG:  337.70 -  320.58; vol based margin of error bounds:  341.84,  316.44META:  670.45 -  635.67; vol based margin of error bounds:  678.86,  627.26TSLA:  459.87 -  430.15; vol based margin of error bounds:  467.06,  422.96TSM:  333.02 -  314.24; vol based margin of error bounds:  337.56,  309.70AMD:  210.93 -  195.41; vol based margin of error bounds:  214.68,  191.66GC:  4751.62 -  4597.18; vol based margin of error bounds:  4788.98,  4559.82SI:  86.44 -  77.96; vol based margin of error bounds:  88.48,  75.92TLT:  88.54 -  87.32; vol based margin of error bounds:  88.83,  87.03ZB:  116.56 -  115.00; vol based margin of error bounds:  116.93,  114.63Thanks for reading Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights!

Market analysisOpEx, Intraday post (20/march) + Fed path and tech (with geos)Crucial postMar 20, 20251814ShareFOMC officials highlighted increased uncertainty and a tilt toward stagflation. Growth forecasts were marked down to about 1.7% for this year, while inflation projections were revised upward for 2025. Earlier, policymakers anticipated a â€œsoft landingâ€ in 2025, gradually lowering interest rates while controlling inflation and maintaining low unemployment. Now, the projections indicate that tariffs are likely to push prices higher, slow economic growth, and increase unemployment, making rate cuts less feasible in the near term.Inflationary pressures stemming from tariffs are proving more persistent than initially anticipated. Powell emphasized that the latest inflation uptick is being driven by an external, tariff-related source.They also announced a significant slowdown in quantitative tightening, from $25 billion to $5 billion per month, which supports a further decline in short-end yields and contributes to front-end spread widening. In response, U.S. rates fell, the yield curve steepened on downside risks, and the USD depreciated slightly.Powellâ€™s press conference was considered more dovish than the SEP implied, with Powell dismissing some longer-term inflation expectations as outliers.The SEP from the FOMC showed a heavy skew toward weaker economic activity and higher inflation risks. While median projections call for two 25bp cuts in 2025 and 2026, the dot plotâ€™s distribution indicates substantial uncertainty, with many participants anticipating fewer cuts. This raises concerns that the Fed could be caught flat-footed if â€œtransitoryâ€ inflation pressures persist.Former Fed officials suggest that if tariff-induced price hikes become entrenched, the Fed may be forced to rethink its policy approach, potentially delaying or even foregoing further rate cuts.The key point I want to emphasize is that the Fedâ€™s dovish rhetoric is underestimating persistent inflation/stagflation risks. As I keep stressing, the negative wealth effect cycle is not over. However the market needs liquidity for further moves now.For now, we can now see that the equity vs. long-term yields correlation remains highly positive. This is a direct result of bull steepening, driven by concerns about U.S. economic growth and expectations that any downturn is already priced in. Investors are anticipating further easing (keeping short-term rates low), while long-term yields remain anchored by longer-term growth and inflation expectations, hence the positive correlation.Meanwhile, newspapers are starting to report that sovereign Middle Eastern funds are showing increased interest in U.S. tech stocks, and the U.S.â€“Russia gas extraction deal is also taking shape.Ceasefire negotiations are also moving forward slowly, in a positive direction - as much as Iâ€™m allowed to tell you.My post about geos is very important. This is what dictates the market as well. This is what is happening. INTRADAY POSTCoding gamma for Friday AM expo:The speed profile is net negative to neutral, with a tail-to-tail slope of -0.13%, but only -0.08% from the midpoint toward tail calls and tail puts.Iâ€™m coding 5595 as the level where puts should start to catch a bid in theory for significant downward strenght, and from there we should start to feel the longer downside gamma effect on the intraday vol profile. Also coding 5680.43 as the level where calls should catch a bid; however, itâ€™s a shorter upside gamma effect, but I donâ€™t think it will significantly affect the intraday vol profile, since the speed exposure isnâ€™t steep enough.The main daily pivot is 5623.59, mark it.The charm profile is net suppressive-to-neutral here, favoring a pinning at the daily pivot. Locally, we also have a very mild positive color (charm convexity) that encourages intraday volatility to be compressed as gamma increases by the time. But remember, lower volatility leads to longer MM delta exposure. At the same time, lower volatility reduces the vanna effect, so theoretically, this setup favors for an oscillating, slightly suppressive trend.As I always say, any deviation will reveal the hands of the hidden customer flow. This is how we use the dealer profile.The models show me that on a wider timeframe any meanâ€‘reverting behavior in the price levels is even weaker now. While on an intraday basis it sees very strong meanâ€‘reversion in the shortâ€‘term fluctuations. So while the overall price level wanders (nonâ€‘stationarity per ADF), the intraday fluctuations are corrected rapidly. The overall regime remains stable, oscillating with a slight positive-to-zero drift.Letâ€™s look at tech alphaâ€¦Here you can see the 20-day rolling tech alpha relative to the SPX benchmark. Below it are the ROC (Rate of Change) values of the alpha curve, as well as their weekly average.We can see that the trend is similar to the behavior we observed last Octoberâ€“November. NVDA still hasnâ€™t caught a bid, nor have AAPL, GOOG, or TSLA. MSFT, META, and AMD are leading the dance instead. For the trend to continue, itâ€™s crucial that their â€œfriendsâ€ catch up soon. The reason is that NVDA and AAPL are heavily exposed to China, while the U.S. aims to strengthen its own manufacturing and reduce reliance on Chinaâ€”a country they ultimately want to push out of economic processes once the new â€œHoly Allianceâ€ is in place.The U.S. is adopting export controls, investment bans, and significant domestic R&D funding to limit Chinaâ€™s access to cutting-edge technologies like advanced AI chips and quantum computing. Meanwhile, China is investing billions in indigenous innovation to reduce dependence on Western technology, fueling a high-stakes investment race.Quantum computing is emerging as a crucial frontier, with contributions from major tech giants (IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) as well as pure-play startups (IonQ, Rigetti, etc.) and government-funded initiatives. Thereâ€™s growing interest from Wall Streetâ€”seen in SPAC deals and large VC investmentsâ€”to support companies that may eventually offer a strategic advantage. At the same time, geopolitical concerns are driving Western efforts to limit Chinese involvement in this sensitive area.Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Public Investment Fund (PIF), led by MBS, is aggressively channeling vast capital into tech sectors (AI, semiconductors, quantum computing) by backing vehicles like SoftBankâ€™s Vision Fund and making direct investments (e.g., in EVs and chip technologies). Other Gulf funds, such as Mubadala and ADIA, are also stepping upâ€”often partnering with Israeli and Western investors. Strengthened by the Abraham Accords, these growing ties create a network where Middle Eastern capital now fuels innovation in regional hubs like Tel Aviv as well as in global tech centers.

And 5535 zero vanna (high vol needed to break through it).5739.5 is needed to break in order to get gamma support for stabilization.5610/5601 is an important support are. If vol can calm down here, price can be stabilized.The net gamma is negative locally. Below the 5683 zero vanna line MMs are short vanna, just as I said above. In theory, intraday spot/vol beta should catch a bid below the vanna flip. VIX key pivot is 23.93 to the upside and 19.21 to the downside. As expected in the weekly post, customers are slightly shorter skew into Friday:The tendency remains intact (hence slightly negative speed profile).SCRIPT INPUTS:SPX99.73%, 5803.70994570753, , 5771.5156752098665, 95.4%, 5739.499992385015, Risk level, 5718.567547601875, 68.2%, 5707.30471728836, 68.2%, 5643.093736505012, Risk level, 5632.012530523125, 95.4%, 5611.080085739985, , 5578.882732070426, 99.73%, 5546.87013241747ES=F99.73%, 5862.302589327331, , 5829.070247905415, 95.4%, 5796.026294663665, Risk level, 5774.42022260331, 68.2%, 5762.792869941547, 68.2%, 5696.515466770091, Risk level, 5685.07977739669, 95.4%, 5663.473705336335, , 5630.238037500838, 99.73%, 5597.197410672669SPY99.73%, 580.5414373439592, , 577.1788408582494, 95.4%, 573.8357211133858, Risk level, 571.6496576222189, 68.2%, 570.473010156455, 68.2%, 563.7671767314865, Risk level, 562.6103521434061, 95.4%, 560.4242886522392, , 557.0613404850003, 99.73%, 553.7185724216658VIX99.73%, 22.73402460635389, , 22.014119966471572, 95.4%, 21.317012112442082, Risk level, 20.855066039426834, 68.2%, 20.59632328610625, 68.2%, 19.178410693517005, Risk level, 18.944933197633713, 95.4%, 18.482987124618464, , 17.760354426880575, 99.73%, 17.065974630706656IWM99.73%, 212.60333630203556, , 211.03924763098604, 95.4%, 209.48666570961154, Risk level, 208.4706310964813, 68.2%, 207.9224907979135, 68.2%, 204.80573134003734, Risk level, 204.2693591378937, 95.4%, 203.25332452476346, , 201.688969135672, 99.73%, 200.13665393233944QQQ99.73%, 495.37151551976604, , 491.73781313982187, 95.4%, 488.13076508410177, Risk level, 485.7702804420752, 68.2%, 484.4968635312789, 68.2%, 477.2559078790981, Risk level, 476.0097488547998, 95.4%, 473.64926421277323, , 470.0149459039582, 99.73%, 466.40851377710896NQ=F99.73%, 20332.14029520839, , 20185.262202389684, 95.4%, 20039.445147604198, Risk level, 19944.02652948523, 68.2%, 19892.559248836063, 68.2%, 19599.85606213849, Risk level, 19549.47347051477, 95.4%, 19454.054852395802, , 19307.152631693327, 99.73%, 19161.35970479161NVDA99.73%, 125.2627196239445, , 123.31184719501663, 95.4%, 121.39135813350546, Risk level, 120.12929428762233, 68.2%, 119.43999330352808, 68.2%, 115.56810642052523, Risk level, 114.91069899851048, 95.4%, 113.64863515262735, , 111.69618311510992, 99.73%, 109.7772736621883AMZN99.73%, 204.1338777729742, , 201.9739799378019, 95.4%, 199.8369355295535, Risk level, 198.43613235819836, 68.2%, 197.67678930964618, 68.2%, 193.37958764283132, Risk level, 192.64385421406726, 95.4%, 191.24305104271212, , 189.08237418474337, 99.73%, 186.94610879929144AAPL99.73%, 223.28941063237963, , 221.26790873467644, 95.4%, 219.26470806277186, Risk level, 217.9526550250797, 68.2%, 217.24303663843412, 68.2%, 213.21815814209296, Risk level, 212.52735596124842, 95.4%, 211.21530292355627, , 209.1932728762393, 99.73%, 207.1906003539485GOOG99.73%, 172.71735382637584, , 171.1004466624776, 95.4%, 169.49867630283637, Risk level, 168.4493874301625, 68.2%, 167.88162403529478, 68.2%, 164.66279573527797, Risk level, 164.11061012843126, 95.4%, 163.06132125575738, , 161.4439614231166, 99.73%, 159.8426437322179TSLA99.73%, 257.87987435013605, , 252.3148597649992, 95.4%, 246.8699374802438, Risk level, 243.28069806065895, 68.2%, 241.30218317447472, 68.2%, 230.2892445839847, Risk level, 228.43930316004418, 95.4%, 224.85006374045932, , 219.2760045174002, 99.73%, 213.84012687056705TSM99.73%, 183.08064255626795, , 180.73546016720275, 95.4%, 178.42031853155194, Risk level, 176.90105289949452, 68.2%, 176.07473858549494, 68.2%, 171.41399538567708, Risk level, 170.61893611417736, 95.4%, 169.09967048211993, , 166.75322875507436, 99.73%, 164.43934645740393AMD99.73%, 111.82875220853357, , 110.42019412913523, 95.4%, 109.02937778273358, Risk level, 108.11678171992278, 68.2%, 107.620588958917, 68.2%, 104.82097146355818, Risk level, 104.3432249939444, 95.4%, 103.43062893113361, , 102.02134062839808, 99.73%, 100.63125450533362Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.18 Likesâˆ™4 Restacks1814SharePreviousNext

Market analysisOpEx, VIXpery and PCE week | Weekly post (17-20/Feb) Feb 16, 2026311SharePython quant course is already available on my Substack-site, by an ex-Wall Street quant.Few times ago, a high significance red-dot appeared on my famous reversion model on the longer time-frame.In this post below, I investigated and explained the reasons: Market analysisThe challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significantâ€”yet still underpricedâ€”risk in the market.Read full storyAnd a free post where I covered institutional flows, ERs, general sentiment and macro context: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 23Read full storyStructurally the market is weak. Distribution keeps going on. Almost everything I wrote about is coming true, see the post linked above, where I collected my insights about the market, the bubble and the structure. Structural cracks have started to appear for everyone, but I donâ€™t think it is the end of the cycle now. Market is about to build a stable support even if itâ€™s only mechanical.For now, NASDAQ is very clear with its ranging pattern since last October FOMC, while SPX is shaky. SubscribeOn this short week, we have FOMC minutes on Wednesday, then PCE and GDP on Friday, along with VIX expo and monthly OpEx. For data release, momentum is shifting towards â€œgood news is good newsâ€.Customers are net selling straddles into Tuesday and Wednesday downward, then a wider and more upside skewed-one into Thursday, then a risk reversal into Friday. I will analyse these more in details, belowâ€¦ Letâ€™s check how the OpEx positioning evolved during the last week: Net gamma exposure has grown by 44.56% total, especially in the range below recent strike ATM. The clusters, where the strongest gamma effect is concentrating are at 6944.09 and 6599.89, marking this band for SPX:Momentum-speaking, as long as SPX remains under 6965.66, there will be no upward trend confirmed: My other momentum model says, market is at monthly equilibrium, ready to start to accumulate negative disbalance, however a weekly avg spot above 6912.76 could disprove it. Below, I will scrutinize, what the market is betting on for these four daysâ€¦ SubscribeFor now, keep your eyes on 6768.47 for ES and 24,327.71 for NQ for any downside momentum to gain confirmation. 6905 for ES and 25,066.36 for NQ are kinda local pivots, but momentum must be confirmet higher. These levels can be used for rangebound games. If both SPX and ES loses 6600, the spot will go back to July levels as market goes against what customers expect. Letâ€™s look at, how the market positions itself for the weekâ€¦ WEEKLY POSITIONING Here you can see the weekly positioning:Speed profileThe net speed profile is positive into Friday, meaning customers are selling upside vol, and buying downside vol. Kinda symmetrical. Centroid is at 6744.05 - 6716.20 range.Downside pivot is at 6611.51Target is 6570.38Upside pivot is at 6907.77Target is 6962.43This pretty much aligns with the technical structure of SPX. Dealer exposure greeksNet gamma is locally negative in the range, meaning customers are net buyers of realized volatility, whileNet color is also negative into Thursday (gamma decreases the most into Wednesday), and flips to positive into Friday. This means that into Thursday market bets on realized volatility expansion into Thursday. Towards the downside (~6678.82 and below), the local net gamma is positive into Wednesday that is supportive, but local color is still negative, pushing the local net gamma to positive, then color flips and pushes local gamm back to neutral into Friday. To the upside (~6943.05 and above) the local gamma monoton decreases but in a lower pace and remains positive, and net speed also remains positive.Net zomma is positive. And on Tue-Wed, there is more zomma on vol down moves, then it becomes very low balanced into Friday. This means, customers expect ATM IV sellers to be trapped along the week. On the downside, the zomma effect increases, skewed towards vol up moves, and flips to negative into Friday. This tells me, that as spot falls, they expect the sudden vol spikes to be shorted, and spot to be stabilized, and expect â€˜vol downâ€™ spot stabilization only on Fridayâ€¦ if spot is there.  Net vega exposure is locally negative too, in the marked range, withNet veta being heavily positive within the range and negative out of it. Downside vega is positive and decreases to negative into Thursday, then decays to zero into Friday. This indicates mechanical vol selling within the range and in case of spot starts to fall. From Thu to Fri, downside is supportive with â€˜vol downâ€™ move, aligning with the zomma exposure. Net vomma is negative within the range skewed towards â€˜vol downâ€™ moves, and impact is increasing into Friday, but relatively low. It is like market expects IV selling. Downside vomma is however positive, so downside vol spikes gonna be sold, and the impact is way higher, ultima is skewed towards â€˜vol upâ€™ moves. (Upside vomma is also net positive, set to break any squeezes, and very highly skewed towards vol up moves.)Net vanna is positive within the range, but negative to the downside. So within the range, market expects more negative spot/vol correlation while to the downside, they expect it to increase. Upside vanna is positive but almost zero impact. Pain is upSo to me, this seems like customers plan to short IV downward into Wednesday, then short vol expecting stabilization or rebound into Thursday and hedge downside heavily into Friday. Like filling downside with liquidity to build a strong support into the coming months, to go towards 7100 during the year after a correction.Upside is the pain trade because the upcoming PCE number is the catalyst, and the marketâ€™s auction structure (a failed move down, bear-trap + nearby thin/single-print structure) makes it easier for price to rotate upward, especially with lots of people positioned bearish.The key level is 6840 in terms of buyback flow.  Skews show growing hedging into Thursday, fear is in:Vomma projected zones:6673.90 - 6725.99 as the downside expectation for the week, and6902.62 - 6934.03 is the upside expectation.As you can see, market expects a false breakout to the downside. Sentiment projectionPutting all together, the projected sentiment is like the weekâ€™s core atmosphere is credibility, fog, reframing, and the cost of illusion, while risk appetite support/â€œvaluations want to floatâ€/softness, relief bids, or â€œit still wants upâ€ mentality increases day by day.Tuesday: mixedâ€‘toâ€‘constructive, but reactive, volatility is high and rising, wider ranging.Wednesday: â€œvolatility-apexâ€ day, very sensitive day. Optimism about inflation is possible, causing a melt-up later.Thursday: shock energy releasing, defensive positioning, market is expected to test support, slowly unfolding consolidation/vol selling, with flat-to-negative drift,Friday: peak of the fogâ€‘meetsâ€‘reality sentiment, most likely rebound and snapbackDip-buyers are ready to step in lower on the range.

Market analysisPost-FOMC | Intraday post (29/Jan)Free postJan 29, 2026131ShareWeekly post: FOMC Week, long zomma/short vomma | Weekly post (26-30/Jan)AlmaÂ·Jan 25Read full storyI dropped a very important broader macro and micro market report containing institutionals, geo, yen etc-etc.: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 23Read full storyAt the intro of yesterday premarket post, I gave you free ES futs signals on the long side that played out perfectly. As said, the main structure is shifted to being formed during the globex, as dedollarization continues, not a coincidence that Powell explicitly did not comment dollar. Also, in the weekly post I said, that Fed day looks like a positive day. For today, the Sunday post predicts a slight profit-taking day, but nothing trend changingFor ES futures 6990/6995 is the main pivot to the downside of 6950/55 and 6900, but for a leg down 6975/80 zone gives confirmation.For upside confirmation, watch the 7030 level.Above the main pivot, the upside vacuum is still on.For Gold 5280 is the main pivot, and 5595 is the upside pivot. I donâ€™t trust this rally on the long term, slowly taking profits. Inflows are still ongoing, as rates are judged as too low.SubscribeLetâ€™s look at the daily positioningâ€¦ INTRADAY POST Coding todayâ€™s positioning: SPX speed profile is net negative. Traders are selling vol into both direction, but more vol is sold to the downside, protecting it. On the weekly basis the 6960-6920 zone is kinda thin, between two untested POCs, but gamma inflow increased by ~23% the while volume is down by roughly 17-18%. Mechanically this tightens the daily sigma range by 0.2-1.2 pts, compressing volatility by 0.12-0.2 pts at max, providing a downside braking effect and pushing the median of the distribution towards the downside pivot line (see below).  This means, traders are about to fill that zone with liquidity, in case of a retest that the market is betting on with 0DTE put spreads in small portion. Naturally if the market burns their theta above the centroid, and the spread-ish pattern cannot start to print (around the downside pivot), then they will unwind it, causing some tailwind to the upside. The centroid of the profile is at 6960.76, exactly at the top of that zone. This is a line in the sand, but any downside should be confirmed at 6945.14 (this zone is supportive and sticky locally. Downside pivot is at 6923.40target is 6913.22 There is a significant chance for a slow rejection back to the centroid if vol does not start to decrease here suddenly. If it does, 6900 is a magnet. (Market tolerates 6888 in case of a sudden â€œlong call trade unwindâ€, if market accepts the level)Upside pivot is at 7014.06with target of 7028.56The target is sticky. Upside speed is slightly positive, but chance is high that the pivot would reject primarly back down to 6975/60, secondary, to 7000 and pin there if 6985/90 is held.

Market analysisPython course is launched | Weekly post (09-13/Feb)Feb 08, 2026141ShareIâ€™m happy to announce that the Python course is now available on my website for all paid subscribers. See details by clicking on the link.Next week I will drop a post about fundamental analysis on BTC, explaining more in details what I already wrote last-year.  Please read these posts, carefully! The challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5Read full storyEarning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 23Read full storyWe have NFP and CPI datas this week.Market sentiment is â€œgood news is not too bad newsâ€ and vice versa. Slightly weak or stagnant NFP is tolerated, but the key is that market wants to see the â€œGoldilocksâ€ case, so that data should imply need/rrom for rate cuts. But not too much, as the signs in the supply-chain are there, like copper supply is under risk. Market started to see that the tech growth wonâ€™t be sustainable on the long-run this way, so the growth slows despite the USD weakness that provided a mechanical increase in market value. When market recognizes that most of the demand comes from the infrastructure-built, thats when the bubble bursts. SubscribeFor this week, what you must watch is how ES behaves at 7005 and 6960/70 zones. This zone remains as a major pivot, confirming/disproving moves. If 7000/05 keeps being rejected, my only speculative buying target is 6910/20 zone. For NDX, this is what you must watch:Shock factor is risingâ€¦ Letâ€™s look at the weekly volatility positioningâ€¦ WEEKLY POSTCoding weekly positioning:Speed profile is flat-to-positive. It may look contraintuitive based on the pic, but customers are buying vol into both direction around 6933.88, but like 1.25x more volatility is being bought to the downside. Centroid is at 6982.65 Upside pivot = 6976.29Upside targe = 7051.22 Downside pivot = 6930.38Downside target = 6719.67This is a very fragile exposure. Customers are not too confidently betting on ranging in the 6869.62 - 6984.62 during the week (close enough to the vol based ranges, see below). Beyond these levels, pain trade comes into play. Market is net hedging downside, hence the far downside target, but locally it sold a put spread into the week, below this given range. Dealer exposureNet gamma is positive, meaning net bet is short realized volatility, with hedging the left-tail. Net color is positive into Wednesday then it shifts to negative, but gamma remains positive at the ATM strikes. Net zomma is negative, meaning positive IV/RV relationship. (I attached the snapshop of the net zomma effect in the 6810.0 - 7025.0 range.) Zomma is kinda flat symmetric into Thursday, when its effect goes up heavily. So right after when the net short RV trade peaks. So here, seems like market expects rangebounding swings getting wider. Into Friday, zomma effect gets flat and net positive: gamma declines on both IV moves, but more deline on â€˜vol downâ€™ moves, hinting an unclench into Friday trapping the ones who bet on a Friday pin.Net vega exposure is also positive, telling me that the base trade is short vol, however,Net color is net negative, becoming significantly more convex after Wednesday. And this is consistent with what the speed profile hints. Net vomma is negative, with a slight asymmetry towards â€˜vol downâ€™ moves by ultima. The effect grows and significantly jumps into Thursday, and - similarly to zomma - int shift to positive into Friday, but even higher impact. This is helps vol crush if any, but also exagerates vol up moves, however based on ultima, marketâ€™s primal bet is â€˜vol downâ€™. The profile remains asymmetric into Friday too, towards â€˜vol downâ€™ move, but in a long vomma profile it means, that path of the least resistance is vol up. This also hints like market foreshadows a flat reversion in vol into Friday.Net vanna is positive, meaning customers are long skew, and there is a slight asymmetry towards â€˜vol downâ€™ moves into Wednesday, and on Thursday it shifts towards â€˜vol upâ€™ moves. Even tho the asymmetry is flat until Wednesday, it tells me that customersâ€™ primal bet is short call vol until Wednesday, then they shift towards long put vol into Friday.The common thing across the exposures is that the peak vol bet falls into Thursday. Fixed strike skew shows very flat 0.54% increase at 22-delta strikes coming from put buying, and a -9.57% decrease at the tails, coming from stronger 22-delta put demand. Smirk convexity is also up by 103.43% from being negative for a longer time, now it is back to flat, meaning customers are longer vomma, that is consistent with the long skew trade, but no bear-panic. Vomma model shows7004.41 - 7038.49 upside zone in case of vol crush that the market prices in, and6789.12 - 6835.08 downside zone in case of vol up. This is a 34.84% difference. Way lower than what the speed profile implies (82.57%). This high discrepancy tells me that the market expects a way thinner left-tail than what the actual convexity makes possible! And this is very dangerous, as vomma is negative until Friday. So the downside vomma zone is a major pivot that can catch many participants off-guard.So all-in-all, the derived sentiment is: Monday: cautious risk-appetite, false breakouts, benign stabilization exists but tends to show up as reversal mechanics, not smooth trend.Tuesday: slightly more benign, valuatino discrepancy, headline anxiety. Ranging.Wednesday: data-reactive, but market is leaning towards positiveness anyway. Cautious risk-appetite.Thursday: risk-off pivot, defensive rotationFriday: looks like CPI will be forced to be interpretet as expansionary, building long-term risk into the markets. Reactions are expected to be exagerated.Letâ€™s look at the weekly vol-based sentiment pivot ranges: SPX:  7007.41 -  6857.19; vol based margin of error bounds:  7043.75,  6820.85ES:  7029.53 -  6875.97; vol based margin of error bounds:  7066.67,  6838.83SPY:  698.28 -  682.96; vol based margin of error bounds:  701.98,  679.26VIX:  19.43 -  16.09; vol based margin of error bounds:  20.23,  15.29IWM:  269.69 -  260.35; vol based margin of error bounds:  271.95,  258.09QQQ:  619.47 -  599.83; vol based margin of error bounds:  624.22,  595.08NDX:  25472.22 -  24679.32; vol based margin of error bounds:  25663.97,  24487.57NQ:  25565.39 -  24761.11; vol based margin of error bounds:  25759.90,  24566.60NVDA:  192.39 -  178.43; vol based margin of error bounds:  195.77,  175.05AMZN:  217.30 -  203.34; vol based margin of error bounds:  220.67,  199.97AAPL:  283.10 -  273.14; vol based margin of error bounds:  285.51,  270.73GOOG:  332.48 -  313.72; vol based margin of error bounds:  337.01,  309.19META:  678.25 -  644.67; vol based margin of error bounds:  686.37,  636.55TSLA:  424.74 -  397.48; vol based margin of error bounds:  431.34,  390.88TSM:  359.75 -  337.95; vol based margin of error bounds:  365.03,  332.67AMD:  219.39 -  197.49; vol based margin of error bounds:  224.69,  192.19GC:  5282.14 -  4975.06; vol based margin of error bounds:  5356.40,  4900.80SI:  86.64 -  73.36; vol based margin of error bounds:  89.86,  70.14TLT:  88.14 -  86.94; vol based margin of error bounds:  88.43,  86.65ZB:  116.30 -  114.70; vol based margin of error bounds:  116.69,  114.31 Subscribe to Stochastic Volatility Trader - Quant InsightsBy AlmaMarket analysis | Trading strategies | Educational content | No financial adviseSubscribeBy subscribing, you agree Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.14 Likes141SharePreviousNext

Free Insights | Market ReportsTheory of Reflexivity by George SorosA very important lecture from 2009Jan 28, 20262422ShareBack in last May, I already shared George Sorosâ€™s lecture after explaining multiple times since 2025 February why the 2025 April crash was the first sign of a changing world order, â€œweighing machine turned onâ€. And I keep referencing to this every week. Without this theory, it is simply impossible to understand how the cycles work, and to â€˜mentally zoom outâ€ of the everyday noise.This post is a note/semi-transcript of his 2009 lecture at Central European University, Budapest (which I was fortunate to attend, as around this time I started to build my portfolio) with some additional annotations from me, where he outlines his theories of fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principle as they apply to financial markets. INTRODUCTIONToday Iâ€™ll apply the concepts I introduced yesterdayâ€”fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principleâ€”to the financial markets. Please brace yourselves, because Iâ€™ll pack a lifetime of experience into this one lecture. The financial markets provide an excellent laboratory for testing the ideas I put forward in abstract form yesterday. The course of events in markets is easier to observe than in most other places. Many of the facts take a quantitative form, and the data are well recorded and well preserved.The opportunity for testing occurs because my interpretation of financial markets directly contradicts the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). That prevailing theory claims that markets naturally move toward equilibrium, and any deviations from equilibrium occur in a random fashion attributable to extraneous shocks. If the efficient market theory is valid, then my theory of reflexivity is false â€“ and vice versa. SubscribeTWO PRINCIPLESLet me state the two cardinal principles of my conceptual framework as it applies to financial markets:First: Market prices always distort the underlying fundamentals. In other words, prices never perfectly reflect the real economic values. (The degree of distortion may vary from negligible to significant.) This is in direct contradiction to the efficient market hypothesis, which maintains that market prices accurately reflect all available information.Second: Instead of playing a purely passive role as a reflection of reality, financial markets can also actively influence the fundamentals they are supposed to reflect. In other words, market realities and market participantsâ€™ perceptions can influence each other. Prices do not merely mirror fundamentals; they can shape them.There are various pathways by which the mispricing of financial assets can occur. The most widely traveled are those which involve the use of leverage, both debt and equity leveraging. The various feedback loops may give the impression that markets are often right, but the mechanism at work is very different from the one proposed by the prevailing paradigm.I claim that financial markets have ways of altering the fundamentals, and that may bring about a closer correspondence between market prices and the underlying fundamentals. Contrast that with the efficient market hypothesis, which claims that markets are always accurately reflecting reality and automatically tend towards equilibrium.These two propositions focus our attention on reflexive feedback loops that often characterize financial markets. There are two kinds of feedback: negative feedback (which is self-correcting) and positive feedback (which is self-reinforcing). Negative feedback tends to push a system toward equilibrium (stabilizing it), while positive feedback pushes it away from equilibrium, producing dynamic disequilibrium. Positive feedback loops are more interesting because they can produce big moves in both market prices and the underlying fundamentals.A positive feedback process, if allowed to run its full course, is initially self-reinforcing (prices and fundamentals move further and further in one direction), but eventually it reaches a climax or reversal point, after which the process becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction. However, positive feedback processes donâ€™t necessarily run to completion â€“ they may be aborted at any time by negative feedback that corrects the course.BOOM AND BUST CYCLES AND BUBBLESI have developed a theory about boomâ€“bust processes (i.e. bubbles) along these lines.Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality, and a misconception or false belief relating to that trend. A boomâ€“bust process is set in motion when a trend and a misconception positively reinforce each other. The process is liable to be tested by episodes of negative feedback along the way. If the trend is strong enough to survive the tests, both the trend and the misconception will be further reinforced. Eventually, market expectations become so far removed from reality that people are forced to recognize that a misconception is involved. A â€œtwilight periodâ€ then ensues, during which doubts grow and more people lose faith, even as the prevailing trend is sustained by inertia. As Chuck Prince, former head of Citigroup, said during the credit bubble: â€œWe must continue dancing until the music stops.â€ Eventually a point is reached when the trend is reversed â€“ it then becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction, as the boom turns into a bust.Let me go back to the example I used when I originally proposed my theory in 1987: the conglomerate boom of the late 1960s. The underlying trend in that case was represented by rising earnings per share for conglomerate companies, and the expectations (or misconception) relating to that trend were reflected in their stock prices. Conglomerates were improving their earnings per share by acquiring other companies. Inflated expectations actually allowed them to keep improving reported earnings â€“ an example of reflexivity where perception (valuations) helped fuel the fundamental (earnings growth). But eventually, reality could not keep up with the marketâ€™s ever-increasing expectations. After a twilight period, the price trend was reversed. All the problems that had been swept under the carpet then surfaced, and earnings collapsed. As the president of one of the conglomerates, Ogden Corporation, told me at the time: â€œI have no audience to play to.â€Typical Stages of a Bubble: Bubbles that conform to this boomâ€“bust pattern go through a sequence of distinct stages:1) Inception: a new positive trend and misconception gain a foothold.2) Acceleration: the boom accelerates as belief in the trend grows.3) Testing: the boom is tested by negative feedback (e.g. a market dip), but if the positive trend is strong enough, it survives and reinforces further growth (a â€œsuccessful testâ€ of the bull market).4) Twilight period: growth slows and cracks begin to appear; skepticism rises, but inertia carries the trend forward (â€œweâ€™re still dancingâ€¦â€).5) Climax/Reversal: reality reasserts itself dramatically â€“ the misconception is recognized and the trend reverses direction (peak of the bubble).6) Acceleration on the downside: the bust feeds on itself, often accelerated by forced liquidation of unsound positions (margin calls, redemptions, etc.).7) Crash/Crisis: the downward move culminates in a financial crisis and panic. Disillusionment turns into panic selling, reaching its extreme in the crisis moment.The length and strength of each stage is unpredictable, but there is an internal logic in the sequence of stages. So while we cannot predict when a bubble will peak or burst, the sequence of stages is in some sense predictable â€“ unless some external negative feedback (say, government intervention) aborts the process at an earlier stage. In the case of the conglomerate boom, it was actually a specific event that constituted the climax: the defeat of Leasco Systems & Research Corporation in its attempted acquisition of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company (a major bank). That failure marked the end of the trend.My breakdown of the current bubble (that is not only on AI/tech) and its consequences can be found here: Market analysisThe challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5In the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significantâ€”yet still underpricedâ€”risk in the market.Read full storyTypically, bubbles have an asymmetric shape: the boom is long and drawn out, often slow to start and then accelerating gradually, flattening in the twilight period; the bust is short and steep, because it is reinforced by the frantic, forced liquidation of leveraged positions. In a bust, disillusionment turns into panic, which climaxes in a financial crisis.The simplest case is a real estate boom. The trend that precipitates it is that credit becomes cheaper and more easily available (interest rates fall, banks are eager to lend). The misconception is the belief that the value of the collateral (the real estate) is independent of the availability of credit. In reality, the relationship between the availability of credit and collateral value is reflexive: when credit becomes cheaper and more easily available, real estate activity picks up and property values rise; with prices rising and easy refinancing, there are fewer defaults, credit performance improves, and lenders feel safer â€“ so lending standards are relaxed and even more credit flows to real estate. At the height of the boom, the amount of credit extended to the sector is maximal and prices are extremely high. Then a reversal hits: credit dries up, loans default, and forced sales of property drive real estate prices sharply down.Yet this misconception (that collateral value is independent of credit) continues to re-occur in various guises. For instance, the international banking crisis of 1982 revolved around sovereign debt (loans to countries) where no collateral was involved. The creditworthiness of sovereign borrowers was measured by various debt ratios â€“ like debt-to-GDP and debt-service-to-exports. These ratios were treated as if they were objective indicators, while in fact they were reflexive: when lenders aggressively recycled petrodollars into loans to countries like Brazil in the 1970s, the influx of credit boosted those economies, so their debt ratios improved. That encouraged further lending, starting a new bubble cycle in sovereign debt. (And when the cycle reversed, those same debt ratios blew out, revealing the earlier optimism as false.)Not all bubbles involve the extension of credit; some are fueled by equity leverage. For example, the conglomerate boom of the 1960s and the Internet stock bubble of the late 1990s were fueled by equity leveraging â€“ companies using inflated stock valuations to acquire others or finance ventures. When Alan Greenspan spoke about â€œirrational exuberanceâ€ in 1996, it misrepresented bubbles. When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire. Thatâ€™s not irrational. And thatâ€™s why we need regulators to counteract the market when a bubble is threatening to grow too bigâ€”because we canâ€™t rely on market participants, how well-informed and rational they are.Bubbles are not the only form in which reflexivity manifests itself. They are only the most dramatic and the most directly opposed to the efficient market hypothesis; therefore they deserve special attention. But reflexivity can take many other forms.In currency markets, for instance, the upside and downside are symmetrical, so there is no sign of an asymmetry between boom and bust; but there is no sign of equilibrium either. Freely floating exchange rates tend to move in large multi-year waves.Perhaps the most important reflexive interaction in markets is the ongoing interplay between financial authorities (central banks, regulators) and the markets themselves. Because markets do not tend toward equilibrium on their own, they are prone to produce periodic crises. Financial crises provoke regulatory reforms â€“ thatâ€™s how central banking and financial regulation evolved in the first place. In this interplay, both the authorities and the market participants are acting on the basis of imperfect understanding, so their interaction is itself reflexive and unpredictable. While bubbles only occur intermittently, the interplay between authorities and markets is an ongoing process. Misunderstandings by either side usually stay within reasonable bounds because market reactions provide useful feedback to the authorities, allowing them to correct their mistakes. But occasionally, the mistakes prove to be self-validating, setting in motion vicious or virtuous circles.Such feedback loops resemble bubbles in the sense that they are initially self-reinforcing, but eventually self-defeating; but otherwise they take quite a different shape. SubscribeNOT ALL PRICE DISTORTIONS ARE REFLEXIVEIt is important to realize that not all price distortions are due to reflexivity. Market participants cannot base their decisions purely on knowledge of the present, because they have to anticipate the future â€“ and the future is contingent on decisions people have not yet made! What those decisions will be, and what effect they will have, cannot be accurately anticipated. Nevertheless, people are forced to make guesses and decisions. To guess correctly, one would theoretically need to know every other participantâ€™s future decisions and their consequences â€“ which is impossible.Rational expectations theory in economics tried to get around this problem by assuming there is a single correct set of expectations about the future, and that peopleâ€™s views will somehow converge on that correct expectation. That postulate has no resemblance to reality, yet it became the basis for much of financial economics as currently taught in universities. In practice, participants must make decisions in conditions of uncertainty. Their decisions are bound to be tentative and biased. That is the generic, everyday cause of most price distortions in markets.Occasionally, the price distortions set in motion a boom-bust process; more often, they are corrected by negative feedback before they spiral out of control. In these cases, market fluctuations appear random â€“ I compare them to waves sloshing around in a swimming pool (small, oscillating, contained movements) as opposed to the tidal waves of a true bubble. The small waves are more  ubiquitous, while the big boomâ€“bust tidal waves are relatively rare, but more significant. In reality, the two kinds of movements intermingle, so actual boomâ€“bust episodes rarely follow the textbook-perfect sequence of my model â€“ there are always cross-currents. True bubbles that dominate everything else are rare â€“ they occur only when a positive feedback loop grows so powerful that it overshadows all other concurrent processes.It is useful to distinguish between near-equilibrium conditions and far-from-equilibrium situations in markets. Near-equilibrium conditions are characterized by humdrum, everyday events â€“ many participants trading on diverse information, feedback mostly negative (self-correcting), price fluctuations looking like random noise. These everyday events are repetitive and lend themselves to statistical generalizations (quantitative models, probabilistic risk management, etc., work during normal times). Far-from-equilibrium situations, in contrast, arise when a bubble or other self-reinforcing process dominates. These give rise to unique, historical events (crashes, panics) where outcomes are highly uncertain and can disrupt the statistical patterns derived from normal times. The rules of thumb and risk models that work in near-equilibrium conditions do not apply in far-from-equilibrium situations. The recent global financial crisis (2007â€“2009) is a case in point. All the risk management tools and synthetic financial products that were premised on price deviations being random and self-correcting broke down during the crisis. People who relied on elegant mathematical models (which had served them well in near-equilibrium conditions) got badly hurt when the rare 100-year storm hit.INSIGHTS OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISISI have gained some new insights into far-from-equilibrium conditions during the recent crisis. As a participant in the markets, I had to act under immense time pressure in 2008, and I couldnâ€™t gather all the information that would have been available under normal circumstances. The same was true for the regulatory authorities in charge â€“ they were also operating with limited information and extreme urgency. Thatâ€™s how far-from-equilibrium situations can spin out of control: events unfold faster than anyone can fully analyze, and decisions have to be made on imperfect information- very important.This phenomenon is not confined to financial markets. I experienced a similar thing during the collapse of the Soviet Union â€“ a period of radical change where no one (including the authorities) had a firm grasp of what was happening or what would happen next. In such situations, participantsâ€™ thinking is â€œtime-boundâ€ rather than timeless â€“ rational expectations theories that assume a kind of timeless equilibrium simply do not account for this real-world uncertainty.I was aware of the uncertainty associated with reflexivity, but even I was taken by surprise by how extreme the uncertainty became in 2008. It cost me dearly. I got the general direction of the markets right, but I did not allow for the volatility along the way. As a consequence, I took positions that were too big to withstand those swings, and several times I was forced to reduce positions at the worst possible time (during a spike in volatility) in order to limit my risk. I would have done much better if I had taken smaller positions and stuck with them through the turmoil. I learned the hard way that the range of uncertainty is itself uncertain â€“ at times it can become practically infinite.Uncertainty finds expression in volatility. Increased volatility forces a reduction in risk exposure, as investors and banks pull back â€“ this leads to what Keynes called â€œliquidity preference,â€ a preference for holding cash or easily sellable assets when uncertainty is high. This dynamic contributes to the forced liquidation of positions that characterizes financial crises. When a crisis eventually abates (calms down) and the range of uncertainty is reduced, it leads to an almost automatic rebound in the stock market. Why? Because peopleâ€™s liquidity preference stops increasing and eventually declines â€“ in other words, when fear recedes, money that fled to safe assets starts coming back into the market. (This is another lesson I learned recently: the sharper the spike in uncertainty and liquidity preference during a crash, the stronger the technical rebound can be when confidence slowly returns.)I should point out that my near-vs-far equilibrium dichotomy was a conceptual tool I introduced to make sense of a confusing reality; it doesnâ€™t perfectly reflect reality, because reality is always more complex than the neat categories we impose. Still, the recent crisis truly was comparable to a â€œhundred-year storm.â€ We had a number of smaller crises leading up to it â€“ those were like five- or ten-year storms. Regulators who had successfully dealt with the smaller squalls were less successful when they tried to apply the same methods to a once-in-a-century meltdown.Here, let me take a pause and share Ray Dalioâ€™s beautiful presentation of economic cycles: SubscribeThese general remarks prepare the ground for a specific hypothesis I have put forward to explain the recent financial crisis. Itâ€™s not derived by deductive logic from my bubble theory, but it is consistent with it. So here it goes: I contend that the puncturing of the U.S. subprime housing bubble in 2007 set off the explosion of a â€œsuper-bubble,â€ much as an ordinary bomb sets off a nuclear explosion. The housing bubble in the United States was the most common kind of boomâ€“bust (distinguished only by the widespread use of new collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other synthetic instruments during the boom). Behind this ordinary housing bubble, however, there was a much larger super-bubble that had been growing over a longer period â€“ and it was much more peculiar.The prevailing trend in this super-bubble was the ever-increasing use of credit and leverage throughout the system. The prevailing misconception behind the super-bubble was the belief that financial markets are self-correcting and should be left to their own devices. President Reagan called this belief â€œthe magic of the marketplace,â€ and I call it market fundamentalism â€“ the idea that markets will tend toward equilibrium and correct any excesses on their own, without the need for government intervention. This belief became the dominant economic creed in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States and Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.What made the super-bubble so peculiar is that financial crises themselves helped it grow. Since the belief was that markets could be safely left alone, the build-up of the super-bubble led to a series of financial crises. The first and most serious was the international banking crisis of 1982 (the Latin American debt crisis). This was followed by many other crises: notably the portfolio insurance debacle in October 1987 (when a new hedging strategy backfired and contributed to the Black Monday stock crash), the Savings & Loan crisis that unfolded in episodes from 1989 to 1994 (thousands of small banks failed in the U.S.), the emerging markets crisis of 1997â€“1998 (Asian financial crisis and Russian default), and the bursting of the Internet stock bubble in 2000. Each time one of these crises occurred, the authorities stepped in: they intervened, arranged rescues or mergers for failing institutions, provided monetary and fiscal stimulus (interest rate cuts, liquidity infusions, government spending) to protect the overall economy. These measures worked â€“ the economy and markets stabilized â€“ and in doing so, they reinforced the prevailing trend (more credit, more leverage, ever-growing financial flows). But as long as the interventions succeeded, they also reinforced the prevailing misconception: the belief that markets left to themselves were coping just fine.It was a misconception because, in reality, it was the authoritiesâ€™ intervention each time that saved the system. Nevertheless, these crises seemed like successful tests of the marketâ€™s resilience â€“ and thus they validated the false belief. Each crisis averted without abandoning market fundamentalism inflated the super-bubble further.Eventually, the credit expansion behind the super-bubble became unsustainable. In 2007, the subprime mortgage market in the U.S. collapsed â€“ and that collapse set off a chain reaction. One market after another fell, in quick succession, because they were all interconnected (the firewalls had been removed by deregulation). This is what distinguishes the 2007â€“2009 financial crisis from all those that preceded it: earlier crises were isolated events or contained by regulations, whereas this time the systemâ€™s defenses were down and contagion spread rapidly. The subprime crisis of 2007 constituted the turning point â€“ the beginning of the end for the super-bubble. The collapse then reached its climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, which precipitated a large-scale financial panic and a global credit freeze. That forced the authorities into the most extensive intervention ever seen.(It is characteristic of my boomâ€“bust model that one cannot predict in advance whether a test will be contained or will spiral out of control. This holds for ordinary bubbles as well as the super-bubble. For instance, I personally thought the emerging market crisis of 1997â€“98 might be the tipping point to burst the super-bubble â€“ but I was wrong. The authorities managed to save the system then, and the super-bubble kept growing. That made the eventual bust in 2008 all the more devastating when it finally came.)After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the financial markets had to be put on artificial life support by governments and central banks. This was a shock not only for the financial sector but also for the real economy â€“ global trade and output plummeted in late 2008. However, the emergency measures did work: financial markets stabilized and the economy gradually revived in 2009. A year after Lehman, the whole episode feels like a bad dream, and many people would like to forget it. There is a widespread desire to treat the 2007â€“2009 crisis as just another bump in the road and return to business as usual. But reality is unlikely to oblige â€“ the system is actually broken and needs to be fixed.RETHINKING REGULATORYMy analysis offers some worthwhile clues to the kind of regulatory reform thatâ€™s needed.1) since markets are bubble-prone, the financial authorities have to accept responsibility for preventing bubbles from growing too big. Alan Greenspan and others have expressly refused to accept that responsibility. If markets canâ€™t recognize bubbles, Greenspan asserted, neither can regulatorsâ€”and he was right. Nevertheless, the financial authorities have to accept the assignment, knowing full well that they will not be able to meet it without making mistakes. They will, however, have the benefit of receiving feedback from the markets, which will tell them whether they have done too much or too little. They can then correct their mistakes.2) in order to control asset bubbles, itâ€™s not enough to control the money supply; you must also control the availability of credit. This canâ€™t be done by using only monetary tools; you must also use credit controls. The best-known tools are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements. Currently they are fixed irrespective of the market mood, because markets are not supposed to have moodsâ€”yet they do. The financial authorities need to vary margin and minimum capital requirements in order to control asset bubbles. Regulators may also have to invent new tools or revive ones that have fallen into disuse. For instance, in my early days in finance many years ago, central banks used to instruct commercial banks to limit their lending to a particular sector of the economyâ€”such as real estate or consumer loansâ€”because they felt that the sector was overheating. Market fundamentalists consider that crass interference with the market mechanism, but they are wrong.Central banks used to do it; we had no financial crisis to speak of. The Chinese authorities do it today, and they have much better control over the banking system than we do. The deposits that commercial banks have to maintain at the central bank were increased 17 times in China during the boom, and when the authorities later reversed course to stimulate growth, the banks quickly obeyed and expanded credit as instructed.Consider the Internet stock bubble: Alan Greenspan identified the tech stock frenzy early (his â€œirrational exuberanceâ€ speech in 1996 shows that). But aside from making that speech, he did nothing to avert the bubble. He felt that reducing the money supply would have been too blunt an instrument to use and could hurt the wider economy â€“ and he was right about that. But he had other tools at his disposal: like, he could have asked the SEC to temporarily freeze new stock offerings. Why? Because the internet boom was fueled by equity leveraging â€“ companies were rushing to issue new shares at high prices and use that capital to fund even more expansion, feeding the frenzy. Limiting new share issuance for a time could have cooled the bubble. Greenspan didnâ€™t do that, because it would have violated his market fundamentalist beliefs (that the government should not interfere with free markets). In hindsight, itâ€™s clear that a more interventionist approach might have mitigated the damage of the 2000 crash.3) Since markets are inherently unstable, there are systemic risks (risks to the entire system) that go beyond the risks to individual market participants. In good times, participants often ignore systemic risk, believing they can always sell to someone else before a crash (â€œIâ€™ll be out before the music stopsâ€). But regulators cannot ignore systemic risk â€“ if too many people are on the same side of a bet, everyone canâ€™t get out at once without causing a market collapse. Authorities must monitor the overall positions of major market participants in order to detect dangerous imbalances. This means the positions of all major actors â€“ including hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds â€“ should be monitored (at least in aggregate). Certain financial derivatives, like credit default swaps (CDS) â€“ insurance-like contracts that pay off if a borrower defaults â€“ and exotic options (like knock-out options, which expire worthless if a certain extreme event happens) are particularly prone to creating hidden leverage and interconnections. Therefore, such instruments must be regulated and, if needed, restricted or even outlawed if they pose a systemic threat. Additionally, creating complex synthetic securities (like structured debt obligations) should require regulatory approval (just as issuing stocks or bonds does), so that regulators can vet new products for systemic risk before they spread.4) We must recognize that financial markets evolve in a one-directional, non-reversible manner. In the recent crisis, in order to save the system, authorities effectively extended an implicit guarantee to every institution deemed â€œtoo big to fail.â€ Now that this has happened, they cannot simply withdraw that guarantee â€“ doing so would undermine confidence. As long as giant institutions exist whose failure would endanger the system, the government is on the hook for them. Therefore, regulators must impose rules to ensure that this implicit guarantee never has to be used. â€œToo big to failâ€ banks must be required to use less leverage and accept strict limits on how they invest depositorâ€™s money. For example, deposits (insured by the government) should not be used to finance risky proprietary trading. Regulators need to go further and align incentives properly: they should regulate the compensation packages of traders at big banks so that risks and rewards are better balanced (to discourage excessive risk-taking for short-term bonus gains). Such measures may push a lot of speculative proprietary trading (trading for the bankâ€™s own profit) out of the banks and into hedge funds â€“ which is actually where those activities belong, since hedge funds can be allowed to fail without requiring taxpayer bailouts.Just as oil tankers are compartmentalized to prevent a single breach from capsizing the ship, the financial system needs firewalls between markets. It may not be practical to completely separate investment banking from commercial banking again (as the U.S. Glassâ€“Steagall Act of 1933 once did), but large financial firms should at least be internally compartmentalized so that risky trading bets cannot bring down essential banking functions. We should also consider breaking up huge financial conglomerates that have become quasi-monopolies or that are simply too complex and big to manage safely.Finally, international banking regulations (the Basel Accords) made a mistake in how they assessed risk. They gave certain securities (like highly rated mortgage bonds, CDOs, etc.) much lower risk weightings than ordinary loans, encouraging banks to hold lots of these securities. Regulators ignored the fact that a concentrated position in supposedly safe securities can be just as risky as regular loans â€“ especially since in a crisis, those securities can all crash in value at the same time (a systemic risk). This flawed rule was an important factor that aggravated the crisis. It needs to be corrected by raising the risk ratings for securities held by banks, forcing banks to hold more capital against them. That will make securitized assets less artificially attractive and probably discourage the excessive securitization of loans going forward.In summary, all these measures will likely reduce the profitability and leverage of banks on average â€“ which is a necessary adjustment for stability. This raises an interesting question of timing. We are not in a position to implement all these permanent reforms immediately without consequences. Right now (late 2009), the financial system and the economy are very far from equilibrium â€“ still fragile after the crisis. You cannot bring a system back to near-equilibrium conditions with one straightforward corrective move. Just as when a car is skidding on ice you must first turn the wheel into the skid to regain control before you can steer normally, in this crisis the short-term actions needed were exactly the opposite of the long-term fixes. In the immediate aftermath of the crash, the credit that evaporated from the private sector had to be replaced by the only credible remaining source: the state. That meant governments had to increase national debt and central banks had to vastly expand the monetary base (create money) to stop the collapse (the equivalent of turning into the skid). As the economy stabilizes, however, the authorities must then â€œturn the wheel backâ€ â€“ shrink the monetary base as fast as private credit revives, otherwise deflation will flip into inflation.We are still in the first phase of this delicate maneuver. Banks are in the process of earning their way out of deep losses (recapitalizing themselves through profits). To prematurely reduce their profitability now â€“ by enforcing strict new capital or lending rules too soon â€“ would be counterproductive and could choke off recovery. Thus, major regulatory reforms have to wait until the second phase, when the economy is on more solid footing and the money supply (credit conditions) can be tightened without causing a relapse. The reforms then need to be carefully phased in so as not to disrupt the recovery. But we absolutely cannot afford to forget about implementing these changes when the time comes.CONCLUSIONYou have seen that my interpretation of financial markets â€“ call it the theory of reflexivity â€“ is very different from the efficient market hypothesis. Strictly speaking, neither theory is easily falsifiable in the Popperian sense (each can adapt to explain events post hoc). I myself predicted the eventual bursting of this super-bubble back in 1998; I was wrong on the timing then. Am I right now? Weâ€™ll see. And indeed some proponents of the efficient market hypothesis are still clinging to it even in the face of the entire collapse we just witnessed.Still, there is a widespread feeling that we need a new paradigm in economics and finance, and I contend that my theory provides a better explanation of boomâ€“bust phenomena than the available alternatives. Behavioral economics, which has been gaining recognition (especially after the crisis), deals with only one half of reflexivity â€“ the misinterpretations and cognitive biases that cause individuals to deviate from rationality. But it does not yet study the feedback loops by which those mispricings and misconceptions can actually change the fundamentals. In other words, behavioral finance focuses on investor psychology, but not so much on how markets can move reality, which is the reflexivity insight.I realize that my theory of financial markets is still very rudimentary and needs a lot more development. Obviously I cannot develop it all on my own. So perhaps I was premature in proposing my theory as the new paradigm. But one thing is certain: the efficient market hypothesis has proven inadequate. In fact, it has been conclusively disproved by recent events. The entire edifice of global financial markets, which has been erected on the false premise that markets can be left to their own devices, has to be rebuilt from the ground up on a sounder conceptual footing.~ George Soros, 2009MY SUMMARY, Key pointsSo, reflexivity describes a two-way feedback loop between market perceptions and the underlying reality. Soros argues that investorsâ€™ biased views donâ€™t just reflect the world â€“ they change it. Very important. This means that market prices can distort fundamentals and, in turn, altered fundamentals can further influence prices. The result is a dynamic, non-equilibrium process driving market booms and busts.So, rather than accurately reflecting all available information (as EMH claims), prices often give a biased view of reality. Investors never have perfect information or understanding â€“ their views are fallible. Soros calls this the principle of fallibility: in situations involving thinking participants, each participantâ€™s view of the world is inherently partial and distorted. For example, exuberant investor sentiment can bid up a stock far beyond what objective earnings would justify. The market price, in such cases, is not a neutral mirror of fundamentals but a funhouse mirror that exaggerates or diminishes aspects of reality.Because investor perceptions are distorted, the actions based on those perceptions can alter the fundamentals they aim to observe. For instance, if investors collectively believe a company is promising and bid up its stock, that company can raise capital cheaply and make the belief true by expanding its business â€“ the initial mispricing changes the fundamental reality.These two principles directly contradict the EMH, because they conclude that participants constantly misinterpret reality and then unintentionally create a new reality by acting on those misperceptions. In such a world, certainty is impossible and predictions can fail because any belief can influence the outcome it predicts, blurring cause and effect.A negative feedback loop is one where any divergence between market price and fundamentals generates pressures to restore balance. In a negative feedback situation, when prices overshoot, forces are triggered that pull them back toward equilibrium (and if prices undershoot, forces push them up). Thus, negative feedback tends toward stability. In a positive feedback loop, a change in price drives changes in fundamentals or investor behavior that further fuel the price move in the same direction. Instead of converging to equilibrium, positive feedback loops lead to disequilibrium: prices and underlying reality move farther and farther apart. A positive feedback process often starts small and feeds on itself: rising prices improve fundamentals, which justify even higher prices, and so on. However, it cannot run indefinitely â€“ eventually the gap between perception and reality becomes unsustainably wide. At that point a reversal or breaking point is reached, and the feedback may even flip to self-reinforce in the opposite direction (a crash). Like Amazon back during the dotcom era, and Tesla during these timesâ€¦ (and other AI names)â€¦Every bubble starts with a real-world trend, paired with a mistaken belief (misconception) that relates to that trend. The trend is something actually happening (e.g. a technological innovation, a policy change, or easy credit conditions), and the misconception is an exaggerated or false narrative about what that trend means. When these two reinforce each other, a positive feedback loop is triggered and a boom begins. As the bubble develops, rising prices validate the misconception for a time. Both the trend and the false narrative strengthen: success breeds more confidence, attracting more capital that further boosts the market. Soros notes that along the way, the bubble is â€œliable to be tested by negative feedbackâ€ â€“ for instance, a minor price correction or external shock might occur. If the prevailing trend and narrative survive these tests (i.e. if the dip only momentarily shakes confidence and then prices surge to new highs), that resilience actually reinforces the belief in the trend. Surviving a scare convinces participants that â€œnothing can derail this market,â€ which brings in even more money. This is why bubbles often accelerate: each pullback that doesnâ€™t break the trend ends up amplifying the subsequent rally, as skeptics capitulate and join in. During this phase, feedback is overwhelmingly positive and self-reinforcing.Eventually, the disconnect between market perception and reality grows too great to ignore. Prices may begin to stall despite continued optimism. This is called a twilight period by Soros when â€œdoubts grow and more people lose faithâ€ even as the trend plateau continues out of sheer inertia. Essentially, cracks in the narrative appear â€“ savvy investors start taking profits or insiders hint at issues â€“ but many participants keep playing the game hoping the music hasnâ€™t stopped. In this stage, the positive feedback has waned; the trend flattens out and complacency mixes with anxiety. Sooner or later, a trigger or tipping point is reached â€“ it could be a policy change, a string of bad earnings reports, tightening credit, or simply a critical mass of investors wanting out. The prevailing trend reverses, and the feedback loop flips direction. Now sell-offs beget more sell-offs: as prices fall, leveraged investors face margin calls and are forced to liquidate, which drives prices down further in a cascading effect. What was once self-reinforcing on the way up becomes self-reinforcing on the way down. The final stage often features capitulation and a financial crisis, as the most leveraged or optimistic players are wiped out. Only after the crash can the market find a new equilibrium (often at a level much closer to fundamental reality, or even below it due to over-correction). From a speculatorâ€™s perspectivean inflating bubble is not a signal to immediately bet against it (short it). Instead, it can be a great opportunity to ride the wave with a long position â€“ so long as one remains vigilant for the turn. Profit-seeking investors will often rationally participate in a bubbleâ€™s expansion, because the early and middle phases of a boom can be immensely profitable. Exiting too early means leaving money on the table, and shorting too early can be fatal (as the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent). When one is net long, time is on his side, when one is net short, time is against him. Great speculators are always waiting patiently for the trend confirmations.This lecture fundamentally shaped my market perspective. It was around that time that I started investing and began experimenting with mathematical models of market moves. Most of my momentum models are built on an extension of this theory and on its implications for market microstructureâ€”models youâ€™ve also seen over the past years functioning with a very high accuracy rate.The most important thing is to be able to identify the liquidity structures that form within a cycle, because those are the marketâ€™s responses to the prevailing narratives and events. And in whether a structure strengthens or breaks, the narrativeâ€”and the market sentiment attached to itâ€”is reflected. This is what many people intuitively â€œfeel,â€ but donâ€™t necessarily understand consciously. This is what I call the context of the liquidity structure. If we understand the context, and we understand how liquidity structuresâ€”and the RoC of supply/demand ratiosâ€”respond to the unfolding of macro events, then the market starts â€œspeaking to usâ€, and we can gain a meaningful edge. (And that is why I so often emphasize: donâ€™t fall for the strange misconception that dealer flows drive the markets. Options positioning is forwardâ€‘looking, because it is the manifestation of bets on the futureâ€”on spot, on time, and on volatility. That is why its real significance lies in the structural context: within that context it projects probabilities that provide substantial help in building trading and riskâ€‘management strategies across different time horizons.) That is why itâ€™s so important to devote as much time as possible to understanding the context and the marketâ€™s responses to it. This requires time and composureâ€”precisely what this artificially accelerated, fake world does not support. But you should resist it anyway. Stop, and give your mind time to catch up with eventsâ€”to let them truly sink in. Educational postsLiquidity structure | Let's put speed profile into contextAlmaÂ·Jan 7During the 2021 GameStop gamma squeeze, the retail crowd discovered the options market and the hedging activity of market makers. The newly discovered â€œlow â€“ the idea that options positioning can directly impact the price of the underlying asset â€“ went through multiple, almost conspiratorial misinterpretations. On the back of this, a lot of furus jumped into building gamma/delta etc. data-providing services, operating on the old â€œsell shovels during a gold rushâ€ principle.Read full storyAnother extra addendumâ€¦Back then, during the 2008/09 crisis, many people believed capitalism had ultimately fallen. Even then, I thought the Western economy still had plenty of tools to get through the weaknesses in capitalismâ€™s ideologies, and new narratives and â€˜fuelsâ€™ were still about to come (internet, AI, increased retail derivative trading activity, etc.)â€”precisely because of Sorosâ€™s principle of reflexivity.However, the situation has already changed: geopolitical realignmentsâ€”because history did not stopâ€”alongside overpopulation, and the fact that our activity is proveably having a long-term harmful impact both on the psyche and on the living world, in ways that after a certain point will no longer be reversible. Yet too many actors have too many chips in the game. All of it needs to be flushed out.To loosen geopolitical constraints and reduce countriesâ€™ dependence on big capital, they want to shift toward national economic models (see USâ€™ new NSS, I predicted this too) that is fundamentally incompatible with the core principles of capitalism. And to halt market competition that accelerates toward the infiniteâ€”in order to place greater weight on quality and to protect the living worldâ€”they want to introduce thirdâ€‘way economic systems, because this cannot be realised in a capitalist world. Capitalism is on its last legs. Iâ€™ll be talking about this in a podcast soon.But the key point is this: capitalism will not collapse because of the crisis; the crisis will come because of the deliberate toppling of capitalismâ€”when the Americans, the Middle Easterners, and the Russians jointly crash the markets and reallocate them onto the blockchain, as I described last year.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

Market analysisWarsh, Gold, Sentiment | Weekly post (02-06/Feb)Feb 01, 2026231ShareDescribing the bubble, the coming crisis, market, economy and geo context: The challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5Read full storyBitcoin analysis for the next 5 years: Bitcoin analysis for the next 5 yearsAlmaÂ·December 3, 2025Read full storyMarket report about macro and micro flows, ER, gold, yen-carry trade, and geo context: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 23Read full storyThe begining of the burst of the bubble is near. Things are changing even faster. Trump, Warsh & Duquesne Last week, Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. There has been extensive speculation about the significance of this move, because the prevailing narrative is that Warsh is a wellâ€‘known hawk. However, it is not that simple. Under Warsh, a â€œfrontâ€‘end easing + backâ€‘end disciplineâ€ regime will emergeâ€”one that would favor a curve steepener, rising term premia, and increased vulnerability in liquidity hedges (gold/crypto). Warsh wants to support the real economy, but not through QE or balanceâ€‘sheet expansion, because that distorts price discovery, creates a â€œFed putâ€ perception, carries inflationary side effects, and is politically exposed.This regime also comes with an AI/productivity narrative and a Druckenmillerâ€“Duquesne network backdrop. If you want to sell the idea that you can cut rates without triggering a renewed inflation scare, you need a â€œproductivity stepâ€‘change (AI/tech)â€ story. Karp/Palantir is the poster child for that.But if balanceâ€‘sheet discipline pushes term premia higher, lifts longâ€‘end yields, and the market begins to slide, thenâ€”by the internal logic of the Fed, the presidency, and the mandateâ€”easing eventually becomes unavoidable. And that will happen soon.Thatâ€™s the scheme hereâ€¦ Subscribe(In many places right now, the Karsanâ€™s Lauder theory that leads nowhere is whatâ€™s circulating. And when, months later, they finally realize what Iâ€™m telling you now, theyâ€™ll present it as if theyâ€™d known it all alongâ€¦)The market is very fragile this week, especially above the 6900 level. Traders are pricing supportive forces below the centroid, but more through the volatility channel than via a clear, spotâ€‘based support line.We have ISM Manufacturing PMI on Monday, PMI on Wednesday and NFP on Friday: In this regime, datas are not that important. Market reacts on policy mostly. But we are in a â€œbad news is good news regimeâ€: Momentum-wise, as long as SPX remains under 6976.35, pressure remains: Customers have increased their put buying activity there. The other momentum metrics also takes me to that level, saying 6976.74 weekly should be taken out in order to gain some positive imbalance. While below 6959.42, the market accumulates negative imbalance, marching towards equilibrium. SubscribeLetâ€™s see, how the market relates to these key zones. WEEKLY POSTLetâ€™s look at the weekly positioning: The net speed profile is flat to negative. Customers are selling volatility into both ways, however even tho there is more realized vol has been sold to the downside, the vol selling to the upside is more convex above 6917.81, so the effect can also be expected to be more aggressive. The centroid of the profile is in the 6835.28 - 6859.74 range. Upside pivot is at 7031.92,with target of 7063.24Downside pivot is at 6715.72with target of 6677.28Market wants to see spot breaking beyond 6772.55 or 6968.19, betting more on downside. Weekly max pain level is 6888.08Letâ€™s look at the greeks exposuresâ€¦Dealer exposureNet delta is negative, switching positive below the centroid, withNet charm being negative with an avg delta decay of 63.01% over the week, but switches positive below the centroid. Net gamma is negative, withNet color being negative, providing room for the realized volatility to increase. (It becomes positive locally only at 6540/50 and 7110/15)  Net zomma is positive until Friday. On Monday and Tuesday there is more zomma on â€˜vol downâ€™ moves (gamma down) than on â€˜vol upâ€™ moves. On Wed-Thu, zomma is kinda balanced, reversing the balance, and on Fri, the net exposure becomes negative, with asymmetry still towards the â€˜vol downâ€™ moves. This effect is the strongest between 6917 and the centroid zone (thats the zero zomma line too). Net vega is negative, withNet veta being positive. So the customers are long vol during the week, and they donâ€™t switch, but the positive vega decay provides some passive vol selling flow, especially into Friday. Net vomma is negative and the effect increases into Thu. This means, that vol moves are amplified by dealer hedging, with asymmetric ultima towards downward vol moves, meaning that if vol goes down, vega goes up is like 6-10x times more than on â€˜vol upâ€™ moves. On the spot axis, vomma becomes postive below the centroid. Net vanna profile is net positive, switching to net negative into Friday. It flips during Thursday. The asymmetry of the vanna profile (zomma) tells me that the customersâ€™ net long skew trade is more about selling upside vol than buying downside. This switches into Friday, when the net short skew trade is about dumping put premiums rather than bidding upside calls, however, the asymmetry is way lower. This also tells me that customers do actually mean that short veta trade into Friday, betting on the smirk being slightly suppressed.So, market sees shorter spot/vol beta, but also shorter IV/RV beta on IV down/RV up, until Friday. What market is betting on with its long skew trades is that call selling will go on and will be complacent, while it is ready to capitalize on downside moves, and it doesnâ€™t expect at all on breaking through the downside target; it locally bets on short rel.vol heavily into Friday. Above the centroid, fragility is expected: in case of a risk off impulse, everything moves into the same direction. While below the centroid, spot meets passive supportive flows. So, overall, the market expects strong supportive forces below the centroid range towards the downside target. Above, the market sees very fragile and volatile environment, that it doesnâ€™t expect to calm down. The OTM call selling is being seen as too aggressive and directly causing pressure on the spot (see vanna and zomma exposure), while it doesnâ€™t see panic and bearish sentiment reversal, rather downside put decay again, with doesnâ€™t really bet on too much upside. The overall bet hence is a rangebound, with net negative drift but not breaking the structure. Vomma model predicts6812.65 - 6853.21 for downside zone, and7001.27 - 7030.70 for upside zone. This is an asymmetry. The downside zone aligns just with the centroid zone, adding a 22.63 to it as â€œtoleranceâ€. But it tells me that market doesnâ€™t expect to reach the downside pivot, rather stabilizating around the centroid. To the upside, the zone is below the upside pivot, telling me, that market doesnâ€™t expect it to be broken either, rather a reversion.Remember, that market bets that here the gamma becomes sharply positive locally, that can have a local pin effect in this zone. If the upside move has momentum with higher fuel to break into this range. So the nature ofthe two zones are different: in the downside zone, the forces that were fragility-creating previously, become supportive here providing a braking effect for the spot. Conversely in the upside zone, it is the localy sharp positive speed, that generates a high long gamma effect, that can be reversionish, if the move lacks momentum. Fixed strike skew shows decreased tail skew and slightly increased 22-delta skew coming from 22-delta put bid. Overall the whole smirk is up by 10.23% Not much, but it makes it rational to make the above-written skew trade. Sentiment expectationsSo all-in-allâ€¦Monday is expected to be moderated but anxious. Tuesday is expected to be more volatile, very headline sensitive, risk-off.Wednesday is expected to be cautiously more calm. Optimism during the AM and moderation during PM. Consolidation after Tue.Thursday is expected to be choppy, and hedging going on.Friday is expected to turn towards slightly more optimistic. Weekly position unwind, worthless downside hedges gonna be closed, providing some support. Risk appetit remains low.

Market analysisWeekly post (09/feb - 14/feb)Including longer-term viewFeb 09, 20254752ShareIâ€™m gonna show you something interesting in this post. Here, I coded the skew for SPX into 18th of February:  In 3D, it looks like this: In the middle (green line) you can see the current ATM strike IV change on the next week, same curve that you can see on the forth chart above. The left side of the skew is the OTM put territory. The farther we go to the left, the less delta OTM put IVs we find. On the right side, it is the OTM calls territory. The farther we go out of moneyness to the right side, the more OTM call IVs we find. As not everything can be observed directly by visual, I meassured the slope of the skew using different points, to see, how the IV rate of changes are evolving during the week. The first chart is the left tail wing, meassuring the slope of the 5d far OTM put and 22d OTM put line segment. The second chart meassures the same for the 22d put vs 22d call,and finally the third chart shows the slope of the line segment from 22d put to the middle point (ATM strike).I added quadratic trendline (with 1 and 2 SDs) to the charts to filter the noise and to make it easire to see the tendency. And additionally I plotted the change in the curve (initial value vs ending value) in percentage terms to see how the trendline actually move relative to each other.Now, you can see, that neither of the IV ratios moved as much as the ATM vol. 5dP/22dP goes -5.612% into Friday, 22dP/22dC moves 5.588% and 25dP/ATM elevates 0.618%, while ATM vol increases 29.008% into Friday alone.Without even looking at the 3D chart, you can tell from these numbers alone that IV surface must form a relatively increasing â€˜hillâ€™ around the ATM middlepoint. What this tells me is that even tho traders hedge the economic data, this activity isnâ€™t that pronunced, and they definitely donâ€™t expect left-tail risk, rather theyâ€™re aiming to catch purely the expected volatility spikes around the releases by being long straddle and strangle. Potentially aiming 6141.13 - 5908.86 SPX range. Letâ€™s look at the dealer gamma exposures for Monday:and Friday: We can clearly see the MM long fly pattern for Monday, and the MM net longer speed for Friday, as it could have been expected from the IV surface. Now, this positioning (locally increased downside gamma towards 5908) is naturally eating up downside vol on both days. Bcs the vol surface shows vol trading rather than directional bet, those positions could capitalize only when price reverts from the bottom. Think about this way: those ATM straddles and strangles are there to catch vol spikes. If the spot starts to fall this would result a spot down/vol down movement, generating losses for those vol speculants, that must be covered. When the spot starts to move up to towards the center of the fly, vol can catch up generating some gains, until reaching the center of the fly, then again starts to dump vol again. However, look at this: this is VIX vol surface. Showing us the hidden vomma selling I warned last week. If vomma keeps being sold, those vol trades vomma decay will become more pronunced if vol catches up, forcing traders to cover more against their position pushing the price further up. My conclusion is that, there is more flows expected to push the price up than down, but as you can see I expect a retest, before they start to cover during the week. My guess is that this is the reason why we see negative changes in the tail hedges, bcs they expect vol up with a wide rangbounding momentum rather than left-tail risk, and they donâ€™t want further losses from those put decays. This makes me maintain bullish bias, but I personally still wonâ€™t take any longer-term options position (until March OpEx), bcs I expect high risk (wide, volatile momentums). At the end, letâ€™s look what GJR-GARCH tells for us about SPX: Looking at SPX, the ARCH Term (Î± â‰ˆ 8.09e-13) says that a shock (whether positive or negative) has almost no immediate impact on the conditional variance. The â€œleverage effectâ€ (Î³ = 0.2177) tells us that the extra effect from negative shocks is present but not very large (pâ€‘value of roughly ~6.4%).I see intraday trading edge more than swing on the call side, but one msut wait for the downside reversions. I go day by day. Watch carefully the daily â€œmargin of errorâ€ range on my provided indicator. SPX must close in this range (if the mean reversion continouse with the rangebound), and close above the daily mean to go further up into Feb OpEx.I expect violent days but overall trend up.

Whatâ€™s the Difference Between a â€œFuruâ€ and an Analyst? (with book recommendations)Let me explain... (free post, off-topic)May 03, 20255822ShareThis is an important topic, because fraud has always followed in historyâ€™s footstepsâ€”scams that preyed on the uninformed or impulsive, leaving them financially ruined. With the spread of the telephone, TV, and then the internet, these schemes have grown even more brazen. Although the law tries to regulate them, it canâ€™t truly protect victimsâ€”ultimately each person decides whether to hand over their money, especially if they havenâ€™t done their due diligence to check whether the promisorâ€™s claim is legit.The essence of liberal capitalism is that the consumer becomes a product, complete with all their personal data and ignorance. Companies, banks, brokers, and businesses trample over one another in fierce competition to get you to spend your hard-earned money with them. This is especially true in the West, where consumer-protection regulations are disastrously lax. And thereâ€™s exactly one reason and one goal behind it all: GDP.Laypeople tend to gravitate toward stock-market â€œgurusâ€ (furus) because their statements are straightforward. Even if theyâ€™re not always right, â€œat least they say something.â€ In contrast, an analyst, in the eyes of a novice, is someone who rambles about complex charts and dynamics without making a clear, straight-ahead market-direction prediction. So the average person picks the guru, simply because someone at least tells them what to do. They donâ€™t have to thinkâ€”just copy-trade, and if they lose, they can blame it on the guru (though there are no real consequences). You donâ€™t get that with an analyst.Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.SubscribeFURUSBecause furus live off non-negligible subscription fees, they need to strive to be as accurate as possible. They pay for analyses and even stealâ€¦ I mean borrow information from other gurus, since competition in this â€œindustryâ€ is fierce. Their hit rates therefore vary.But their content tends to be overly straightforward. Why? Because furus are in a guessing race with each other. A furu must demonstrate a certain hit rate to appear credible to subscribersâ€”so they canâ€™t make ambiguous, polysemous statements. And if theyâ€™re wrong, the subscriberâ€™s risk management techniques are blamed (though teaching risk management is something furus rarely do). Furus lie about their winâ€“loss stats, claiming special knowledge that makes them able to predict every future market moves. They promise this secret knowledge with massive overnight profits and laugh at Warren Buffett.The key attributeâ€¦Okay, this is all very common among anyone who are actively marketing themselves. But the key attribute is the lie that sets furus apart from analysts is the claim that market movements are always precisely predictable. They say this because, if market moves were always predictable, their â€œsignal serviceâ€ would be justifiedâ€”and if a prediction hits, they can take full credit. That, however, is simply wrong.ANALYSTSA responsible analyst doesnâ€™t think that way. You all know already that probability measures the area of specific event-sets within the universe of possible outcomes. There are times when certain market moves have an estimated probability above 80â€“90%. But a responsible analyst always thinks in terms of a probability distribution. That means examining the driving engine behind current market dynamics, then mapping out possible scenarios and their conditions (events, timing, price levels, and their implications). From this you get scenarios A, B, C, and D, each with assigned probabilities. Once you understand the market-dynamic engine, the conditions for A, B, C, and D can be well-defined. A subscribing customer can then apply the analystâ€™s framework to shape their own portfolio, trading style, and strategy. A responsible analyst must remain unbiased about market direction, since only one move has a 99.99â€¦% probabilityâ€”namely, that price will move from left to right. Even that isnâ€™t 100%, since global catastrophes have non-zero probability. After mapping the dynamics and defining scenarios and their conditions, the analyst could design a portfolio strategyâ€”but that falls under personalized financial or investment advice, which is a legal category unto itself. Iâ€™ll note that even a guruâ€™s â€œsignal serviceâ€ borders on that line and often falls into illegality.So, unlike gurus who pander to lazy mindsets, an analystâ€™s article is merely a foundation. The trader uses their own knowledge to build their trading, investing, and risk-management strategies. From that point on, itâ€™s their responsibility. This is crucial to understand this distinction.Unnecessary disclaimerâ€¦As I clarified at the start, my Substack service is focused on providing analysis only. It does not include signal services or personalized (or even general) financial or investment advice. Its primary goal is to satisfy the year-long demand for insight into how I think about marketsâ€” that I try to do through daily and weekly analyses, as well as themed educational posts.The key is learning to think in distributions. If you bet according to a well-estimated distribution of probabilities, your winning position will offset losses on the other side. Once you see the winning-condition scenario unfolding, you close your losing positions and increase your winners. This is how the pros do it. But it truly requires work.Thereâ€™s a wealth of excellent educational material on the subject freely available online. Here are just a few to get you started (beside every free articles I attached to my educational posts):Richard D. Wyckoff - The Day Traderâ€™s BibleBenjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor G. C. Selden - Psychology of the Stock MarketJ. J. Butler - Successful Stock Speculation Sheldon Natenberg - Option Volatility & Pricing Collin Bennett - Trading Volatility Nassim Taleb - Dynamics HedgingAnd also I highly recommend these following books for speculants: CÄƒtÄƒlin BÄƒrboianu - Probability Guide to GamblingAn exhaustive compendium of probability results for dice, roulette, slots, poker, and sports bets, with rigorous finite-sample probability foundations and combinatorial analysis. and - Understanding Your Game: A Mathematician's Advice for Rational and Safe GamblingEdward Packel - The Mathematics of Games and Gambling A mathematically sophisticatedâ€”but accessibleâ€”text covering game-theoretic models and probabilistic analysis for a broad array of gambling scenarios, including sports betting.Edward O. Thorp - The Mathematics of GamblingBy the pioneer of card-counting and quantitative trading; explains probability calculus in blackjack, baccarat, and introduces risk management principles through precise mathematical modelingDavid L. Dickinson - Gambling Habits and Probability Judgements in a Bayesian Task EnvironmentExamines how gamblers update beliefs using Bayesâ€™ theorem, shedding light on cognitive biases in probability assessments. Siam Malhotra - Statistical Models and Predictive Algorithms in Sports Betting Bayesian Approaches, Machine Learning, and Monte Carlo SimulationsSurveys Bayesian methods, machine-learning techniques, and Monte Carlo simulations for modeling sports outcomes, emphasizing rigorous probabilistic frameworks. Walsh & Joshi - Machine Learning for Sports Betting: Should Model Selection Be Based on Accuracy or Calibration?Demonstrates that selecting predictive models on calibration (i.e., probabilities that match observed frequencies) rather than classification accuracy yields superior expected returns. Karl Whelan - Risk Aversion and Favouriteâ€“Longshot Bias in a Competitive Fixed-Odds Betting MarketEmpirical and theoretical analysis of why longshot bets underperformâ€”and how risk preferences shape market oddsâ€”in online fixed-odds platforms.There is no royal roadâ€¦This is just a small taste of the freely available studies and books you can learn fromâ€”not to mention the articles Iâ€™ve linked in my educational posts. As you can see, peopleâ€™s problem isnâ€™t a lack of sources but plain laziness. As Warren Buffett said, â€œThe more you learn, the more you earn.â€And my favorite comes from Dwayne Johnson: â€œPeople ask me whatâ€™s the key to success? The key is there is no key. Be humble, be hungry, and always be the hardest worker in the room.â€Words to live byâ€¦Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

# Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update

Market analysisWindow of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update Oct 29, 20253042ShareWhat on earth is going on in these markets?There are no gap fills, valuation metrics are on the moon, the put/call ratio is in Chinaâ€”along with market breadthâ€”while the SPX/VIX/VVIX correlation is trending higher. Every dip is being bought, levered up via the options market; short-vol and short-vomma trades are aggressively crowded, and lately theyâ€™ve even been attacking realised volatility and realised vol-of-vol too.The reasons should be sought in the globally shifting geopolitical landscapeâ€”much like when political parties campaign for power: burnishing their achievements by falsifying and wrenching them out of context to look better to their supporters. I wrote at length about this earlier, in April. Please (re)read it. Pro tip: donâ€™t believe that China will ever give up. Eastern people are patient and tactical, unlike Trumpâ€¦Window of RiskMy earlier â€œWindow of Riskâ€ (WoR) calls this year were: Februaryâ€“April window â€” I flagged the April drop days in advance, with then-unbelievable downside targets that were hit.Correction in May â€” My primary WoR ran from the May ECB rate decision to mid-May (Trumpâ€™s visit to the Middle East). We saw a ~97-point decline in SPX, but the market did not break my target level from which momentum could have flipped into left-tail risk.(Later, a 124-point decline materialized after Trumpâ€™s visit, but that wasnâ€™t the risk I expected; it followed directly from weekly positioning with an exact target. The same applies to the 107-point decline in the 16â€“20 June week.)July/August window â€” Essentially my original major WoR: the post-NFP and FOMC period, once tariff effects began to show up in the data. I marked it into mid-August. The effects did start to appear, and we got a 215-point declineâ€”still not a break of the level that would have triggered the left-tail risk Iâ€™d been flagging.(In mid-August another 138-point decline followed, but again the structure held. By mid-July it had also become clear to me that the market would remain supported, and I emphasised that my WoR was shifting towards the post-September OpEx period.)Post-September OpEx â€” I called for supportive flows into Monday and the WoR starting on Tuesday: that produced a 130.3-point pullback. I then called for volatility and vomma supply, and for the week of 6 October I flagged weakness and a potential vol spike into the Thuâ€“Fri window, which delivered a 213.8-point pullback.The common feature of these shake-offs is that none of them broke the structureâ€”neither in dynamics nor at key levelsâ€”and this was highly likely on the basis of weekly flow analysis, as I kept updating in intraday posts. Quantitatively speaking, even the quant funds did not hit any triggers. As I warned, risk kept being eroded via time correctionâ€”a superficial, paper-only erosion rather than a real one. SubscribeFlowsSPX/VIX/VVIX are green â€” though the last only slightly, relatively speaking. This says that whole curve is bid. Yet, there is still no volatility squeeze, because realised volatility and realised vol-of-vol remain managed intraday and via weekly zomma. What I mean is this: to the downside, realised volatility is being sold, as the downside convexity of the short-speed profile compresses intraday returns; to the upside, returns can widen because there is an upward vacuum. On an intraday basis, both realised and implied volatility are being sold via tail gamma and VIX. Zomma is also being supplied again. Meaning, we are at the right-end of the curve, where the gamma/IV relationship is positive, managing realised vol in the event of a gamma squeeze. Because being short gamma means to be short realized volatility.These are the force that is preventing any volatility squeeze for now. And this is crucial for the insiders because volatility would indicate crash now, something they cannot let to happen again. SubscribeRetail speculators have emerged as a major force (over 22% of total volume), consistently buying stocks even as institutions step back roughly 85% of the time. 0DTE flows made up about 62.4% of total SPX options volume. Meanwhile, large institutions are keeping their core holdings (so as not to lag the indices) but have added hedges and simultaneously reduced positions in roughly 90% of the weeks since August. They are sceptical of this rally; their sentiment is heavily negative, they see greater risk in holding longs, and they are scaling out into strength â€” but only gradually, so as not to bombard the market with sell orders or risk underperformance. They want to reload once the market is trading for discount again.The supply is being absorbed by dealersâ€™ intraday and weekly longer realised- and implied-volatility positions on the downside, and by retail flow. And this is crucial, because it means the momentum we are experiencing is not fully organic. The constant, shady misses of gap fills are a tell. In other words, this rally is not the result of large long-term institutions pouring in; it is largely mechanical, driven by dealers and fast-money traders leveraging options. The exact mechanisms of these dynamics are described in-depth in this (free) September post: Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tellsAlmaÂ·September 18, 2025Read full storyOctober rate decision FOMCSPX/yields correlation is positive ahead of the FOMC, though it has eased over the past few sessions. That may suggest Bessent is not expecting an especially dovish aftermath, but only short-lived, we will see.  A rate cut is widely viewed as a done deal and largely priced in, which is why forward guidance matters much more at this point. If the Fed does not exceed dovish expectations, there is a riskâ€”indeed, a short-term opportunityâ€”of a â€œsell-the-newsâ€ dip. Markets also expect the Fed to announce an end to quantitative tightening. I do not expect any crash to happen in the mid term. However, I still expect my 6â€“10% correction to play out soon. Statistically, when the Fed cut rates when the market was within 1â€“3% of an all-time high, the market was up by 14.95% on average within the next 12 months, in an average of 96.5% of cases (including 2019 and 2024). Novemberâ€“December window is historically the strongest months for actual buyback executions and volatility selling.However, keep in mind that going against seasonality can be a major source of liquidity for the insiders if they want to reloadâ€”not fully going against it, but enough to create a brief scare before the end-of-year rally. Corporate demand is set to return robustly in November, adding a steady bid for stocks. ShutdownThe shutdown was not accounted for when I wrote my â€˜Window of Riskâ€™ post in September. I marked the end of that window at the end of the buyback blackout. That is right, butâ€”as I keep emphasisingâ€”on the longer tenor there is a synthetic, hidden long vomma in the market due to geopolitical risk, which makes the market headline-sensitive. So the â€˜Window of Riskâ€™ will end when shutdown ends and we start to receive the data again.Active data collection is halted under the Labor Departmentâ€™s contingency plan. The September CPI was compiled and released late (24 October) because much of that monthâ€™s pricing had already been gathered; October CPI collection has been disrupted, and the White House and media are signalling no October CPI release next month. This means survey interviewing, price collection, data processing and most publications stop. We can therefore expect heavier revisions later and, in some cases, skipped months, and the data may become more controlled. When the funding bill is signed (a continuing resolution or full-year appropriations), the shutdown ends. No date yet.Target and strategyAs you may know, Iâ€™m net bullish for the next 4-5 years. I already covered this.My recent target for this window is shown here: As you can see on the chart, I estimate the maximum target for a potential melt-up at 7,146.88 for SPX and a downside target at the August-peak/October-bottom liquidity zone.This is a primary target, because the book has been very thin since the summer. Given this thin positioning data, it is hard to estimate exact potential scenarios.However, I donâ€™t expect any crashâ€”only a pullback, a local left-tail event where we can take yearly risk-on bets. Until structure breaks and pullback is confirmed I use flies, ratios and calendar spreads as a hedge to catch front-end volatility. Iâ€™ll keep you updated in the Sunday posts and intraday posts with levels, dynamics and distribution. Stochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

As Iâ€™ve already written in my earlier educational posts about trading strategies, the pivot and the probability levels primarily function as checkpoints that provide information about the given price action and the underlying sentiment. I mark downside and upside targets, as well as local pinning and additional supportive/suppressive targets, separately.

# Above the line..., China vs US - Intraday post (25/April)

Market analysisAbove the line..., China vs US - Intraday post (25/April)Apr 25, 2025âˆ™ Paid1522ShareAs I mentioned in this morningâ€™s chat, Witkoff is currently in the Kremlin. Fresh development: in Balashikha, Major General Yaroslav Moskalikâ€”deputy head of the Russian General Staffâ€™s Operations Directorateâ€”was killed by a car bomb. Putin has not yet responded. He knows the EU is trying to derail peace talks; heâ€™ll react in due course.This makes negotiations much tougher, since it forces Putin to refuse any peace proposals. Itâ€™s now clear who really doesnâ€™t want to negotiateâ€¦In any case, Trump and his team are still pushing, aiming May 9. Today is a critical moment. My sources said, that Putin is in good mood today, but heâ€™s not known for forgiveness. Itâ€™s a difficult, unpredictable situationâ€”letâ€™s keep a close eye on the news. This is Trump's timeline for now. Very important to analyse, as it is always a message for the diplomats: Ceasefire â€œin two weeksâ€ = implied deadline of May 9Witkoff in Kremlin = Steve Witkoff arrives in Moscow April 25 (assasination)Talks in Rome = Trump attends Pope Francisâ€™s funeral April 26May 9 = target date for a tentative ceasefireSaudi trip = Trumpâ€™s visit to Saudi Arabia May 13â€“16Each stop builds momentum toward a ceasefire; Trump said: â€œa lot of pressure on Russiaâ€ and suggested â€œit would be clear in two weeksâ€. Before heading to the Gulf, Trump will attend Pope Francisâ€™s funeral in Rome,  where he can meet European leaders and press for unity behind his peace timeline (+ they will discuss tariffs). Immediately after that window, Trump goes to visit Saudi and Qatar/UAE on May 13â€“16, where he plans to unveil a $100 billion+ arms package.Romeâ€™s funeral and the Saudi visit provide stages for bilateral side-talks.. something that is ideal for discreet pressure or concessions.As explained yesterday, China was lying about the talks. No deal, of course, but talks has been on under the surface. (I told you that Iâ€™m good at pokerâ€¦)This is very important, because it means Trump and Xi may succeed in striking a deal with the EU whereby China withdraws its support from Europe. In exchange, theyâ€™ll strengthen their diplomatic ties. Remember that the Chinese Communist doctrine is compatible with a multipolar world order. And that the primal goals of the tariffs are about to force EU to negotiate. When it is done, tariffs will be cancelled. But for now they still play that poker game, and trying to waste USâ€™ time as much as they can.If this turns out to be the case, then the U.S. will gain significant leverage towards Putin in the ceasefire negotiations. I hope you all appreciate just how risky all of this isâ€¦Datas coming next week, stagflationary pressures are still there. Negative wealth effect takes some time. ECB meeting is coming too, they will likely cut, as said before many times. And supply chain issued will also unfold: Data shows YoY drop in vessel calls and import volumes at the San Pedro Bay complex. Imports there could decline as early as May, following a 64% collapse in import bookings from China between March 24â€“31 and April 1â€“8, projecting more than a 44% drop in vessel calls in the week beginning May 4, compared with a year earlier. Maritime consultancy Drewry forecasts a 1% fall in global container port throughput due to US tariff policies. imports surged 11% year-over-year in March as shippers rushed goods in before tariff hikes; ship-traffic queues at West Coast ports down 44% this week versus late April. This causes an artificial lull in May arrivals, even potential masked stoppage. My sources say that the numbers will be worseâ€¦Global geo post;Weekly post My market call isâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

The rate cuts serve to mask these fragilities. If markets sniff balance-sheet flexibility, they wonâ€™t assume growth â€œstimulusâ€; theyâ€™ll assume floor under liquidityâ€”i.e., lower left-tail vol, not higher earnings. That helps explain why risk rallies fade when geopolitics worsen: the â€œshock absorberâ€ keeps plumbing working, but doesnâ€™t fix risk premia. There are new covert ops in Venezuela with escalation paths (sanctions â†’ covert action â†’ kinetic) that usually richen front-end equity vol, bid gold, and flatten curves in the first instance. And the market is vulnerable to a disorderly correction if policy/geopolitical shocks collide with stretched valuations and deficits. HY OAS is only ~3.1%; MOVE sits mid-70s â€” elevated enough to transmit macro shocks to equities, but not â€œpanic,â€ which can breed complacency. Not priced in at allâ€¦Institutions are slowly accumulating puts against retails, despite crowded short vol trade into the OpEx (VIXpiry next week), CTAs are expected to reduce exposure. Tactically owning downside protection into near-term event risks is clever, with a plan to fade vol as blackout ends and corporate demand returns.Never forget, what I wrote in the weekly post and the â€˜window of riskâ€™ post: market is again headline sensitive!

Market analysisAfter FOMC and US-UAE deal, Intraday post (08/May)May 08, 2025âˆ™ Paid1814ShareFOMC is unfolded as we all expected, and also we got the pre-Fed pullback. Traders see only about a one-in-four chance that the Fed will cut at its June meeting, and by July 30, the odds jump to over 60%The gap between yesterdayâ€™s fed-funds rate and the falling implied curve creates room for 2s10s steepening trades as longer maturities come down later in the year. However, listenâ€¦When investors buy 4-, 8-, 13- and 17-week bills, bank reserves fallâ€”pushing money-market rates up toward the Fedâ€™s target. If demand slackens, dealers absorb bills then monetize them via the Fedâ€™s RRP and repo facilities, stabilizing yields. By selling more bills (and fewer notes), the Treasury reduces long-end supply, which buys down those yieldsâ€”a hidden QE. And meanwhile just before the minutes I warned you all that market is building â€˜crash matsâ€™ for the momentum by selling OTM puts, vol carry trades: Let me show you something interestingâ€¦ SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# After NFP, Fed, Weekly post (05-09/May)

Market analysisAfter NFP, Fed, Weekly post (05-09/May)Limit-order-hunting, short vol?May 04, 2025âˆ™ Paid5127ShareIntroductionBy setting aggressive, high tariffs and then hinting at cuts only under specific deal conditions, Trump risks whipsawing industriesâ€”exporters, importers, and manufacturers. Credible policy frameworks need built-in flexibility; otherwise, they degrade trust. While tariffs can provide leverage, they must be part of a dynamic playbookâ€”with clear, phased adjustments linked to verifiable benchmarksâ€”rather than one-off spikes and indefinite hangs. And this is important because U.S. efforts to reset ties with Russia are constrained by a robust Sino-Russian allianceâ€”limiting his diplomatic options and complicating any peace or trade initiatives. This poses a huge risk on Taiwan, as the display of unity between Beijing and Moscow accelerates the closing window for deterrence, sharpens the PLAâ€™s doctrinal edge from Ukraine lessons, and intensifies Taiwanâ€™s historical-narrative campaign. But more on this after the Victory-dayâ€¦ until Trumpâ€™s next movesâ€”signals of support for Russia, pressure on Kyiv/EU, or mediating languageâ€”will either validate or derail Putinâ€™s tentative overtures, defining U.S. influence in the final days before Victory Day. Xi is playing for Trumpâ€™s weaknesses, and he is playing well. Keep your eyes open and watch the dates and the events I markedâ€¦After NFPâ€¦Aprilâ€™s jobs reportâ€”showing 177,000 payroll gains (well above the 138,000 median forecast) with no meaningful uptick in unemploymentâ€”provides the Federal Reserve with little justification to shift from its â€œwait-and-seeâ€ approach to cutting interest rates at the June meeting. Fed officials have signaled rate cuts will require clear signs of rising unemployment, not just moderating job gains. Given Aprilâ€™s unexpected strength, the Fed is likely to hold rates steady at 4.25 â€“ 4.50 percent on May 6â€“7, offering little if any new dovish guidance about June cuts. However it also raises the bar for any future easingâ€”meaning that real rate cuts may be pushed well into 2026 unless tariff shocks trigger a sharper slowdown in the coming months.They see the coming stagflation risk.  By early May, the index had regained all of those losses, trading back above its April 2 closeâ€”an impressive rebound driven by tariff-pause hopes, strong earnings and solid jobs data. The index finished 2.92 percent higher for the week ended May 2 and 7.65 percent higher over the last two weeksâ€”the largest two-week gain since October 2022. However, donâ€™t fall for the mechanical and artificial squeeze we are experiencingâ€¦ The 10-year Treasury yield has risen 0.146 percentage points to 4.317 percent, pushing it above its level on April 2, reflecting market conviction that the Fed will maintain restrictive rates for longer, given strong jobs data and delayed tariff effects. With the front-end of the curve essentially parked at Fed funds levels and the back-end rising, yield-curve flattening persistsâ€”an indicator of policy tightness and slower long-run growth expectations.The strong April jobs data temporarily alleviated recession fears, but ongoing uncertainty about Trumpâ€™s â€œstop-startâ€ tariff rollout, the coming stagflation, coupled with geopolitical tensions will keep volatility elevated. This is a bear market rally. I said that if the VIX falls below a certain level, the short squeeze and the artificial, algo-driven buying flow (based on sentiment manipulation via headlines) would get a vanna tailwind. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re experiencing right now. It will end when the government runs out of good headlines and has to face a reality check.The market is technical and policy-flow driven. Deep bearish puts wonâ€™t pay because tariff-driven growth headwinds and supply-shock inflation only intensify in mid-summer, per your earlier freight-delay timeline. Distress-trade payoffs are most likely around the Julyâ€“August tariff cliff, not now.Ahead of FOMC and heavy data, SPX is expected to range bound in the 5566.89 - 5754.47 range with key line to hold on Monday is 5627, then on Fed day giving some volatile intraday but closing within the prior sessionâ€™s highâ€“low band.May OpEx also looks supportive for now, but will update on OpEx week. I maintain short vol strategy as my main trade since Apr 13 and Apr 17, not betting too much on deltasâ€¦ This also implies that more vol down = more squeeze to hold the market.Now let me tell you something very important about this range and the actual levelsâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisAhead of datas, Short-term positioning shift, Risk/reward shift + Intraday post (02/July) Jul 02, 2025âˆ™ Paid15ShareSentiment and risk/reward shift ahead?Yesterday, Powell spoke in ECB conferenc in Poland. He reaffirmed that the Fed remains data-dependent, weighing each meetingâ€™s economic indicatorsâ€”particularly on inflation, employment, and the effects of recent tariffsâ€”before deciding on interest-rate cuts. He emphatized that that U.S. tariffs have elevated core inflation forecasts, necessitating caution, and that he needs to wait for incoming jobs, CPI, and tariff-impact data. We have NFP, PMI and unemployment rate datas tomorrow.After the tariffs deadline trade-war escalation threatens both growth and the Fedâ€™s easing window. Sentiment is actually about bad news are bad news, the trend is already clear:  Market bets on this tariff shock and datas into next week with a heavy short fly spread at 6000/6070/6145, now as a short vega, vomma and charm, and long veta, long vanna, theta and delta bet. This creates a heavy local support in the 6162-6132 field, centered around the wing of 6145, creating a heavy demand bid there, with dealers swallowing vol up on downward moves + local MM long gamma effect. But the decay flow is suppressive bcs of charm and veta, flooring the vol and supports my â€˜grind up from next week with vomma supplyâ€™ theory. As on the longer tenors, SPX is getting net longer vanna (but not confirmed by the vol complex, look at only VIX fighting with my 16.5s pivot), the mechanical vol grind up would cap the upside. That shifts the risk/reward, hence I took positions I described yesterday. The risk is the MM short veta factorâ€¦ SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisAhead of FOMC, Intraday post (05/May)Elaborating on the bulltrapMay 05, 2025âˆ™ Paid1511ShareI added very important levels and notes to the weekly post. Refresh and re-read it! Also on Sunday, I posted a list of books and researches that help you to think in distribution instead of constant duality. The U.S. Commerce Departmentâ€™s Section 232 probe into semiconductors opened a public comment period that ends this Wednesday, May 7â€”after which the administration can impose tariffs without further notice. Only ten comments have been filed on semiconductor tariffs, versus ~300 for prior copper or lumber probesâ€”suggesting limited industry or public resistance, which the Trump team could read as tacit approval. 25% - 100% duties may be imposed as soon as this week, keyed to the â€œwafer-outâ€ location where chips are made. The probe covers everything from substrates and bare wafers to advanced chips and manufacturing equipment, underlining the broad reach of any final tariffs.With the comment window closing mid-week, tariffs could be announced immediately before or after the Fedâ€™s May 6â€“7 meetingâ€”adding a fresh growth-shock uncertainty. The lack of industry filings means minimal opposition, making it more likely that the Trump administration will see a clear runway to enact steep tariffs. Heavy chip duties would raise input costs, squeeze margins, and slow semiconductor-driven capexâ€”potentially delaying Fed rate cuts or even forcing additional tightening, exactly as I warned you. If tariffs land just before the Fed, it amplifies reasons to â€œsell into strengthâ€ ahead of the rate-decision, as it adds another headwind to growth. Markets have already repriced Fed cuts out to July; an imminent chip-tariff shock could push that horizon even furtherâ€”and steepen the yield curveâ€™s back end. Risk/reward is still on the short delta side (while I hedge upside, and vol decay).

Market analysisAhead of FOMC Pt. 2 : Heading into a liquidity crisis Intraday post (06/May)Educative contentMay 06, 2025âˆ™ Paid201ShareWeekly postAfter reading my yesterday post, look Yesterday I posted this on Twitter: Now look at inflation expectations: Note, that the inflection points of the M2 coincidences with upsticks of inflation expectations, hinting that market participants and consumers view broad liquidity as a key driver of prices. Key to understand my bulltrap-call.Let, me explainâ€¦ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid Index returned to expansion in October 2024 near ~55% and climbed to 69.8% in April, its highest since June 2022, and the ISM Nonâ€Manufacturing Prices Paid Index similarly jumped from ~58% in October 2024 to 65.1% in April, its strongest pace since January 2023. Readings above 50 % signal that a majority of firms are paying more for inputs. Both surveys have spent seven straight months above 60 %, consistent with sustained price pressures. Swings of 4â€“5 points monthâ€toâ€month (e.g., Dec +4.0 pts, Apr +4.2 pts) reflect tariff cycles, commodityâ€price moves (steel, lumber) and freight bottlenecksâ€”all passing through into higher procurement costs.In Manufacturing, five of the six largest industries (Machinery; Chemicals; Food & Beverage; Electronics; Transportation Equipment) reported higher rawâ€material costs in April, while in Services, arts & recreation was the only segment reporting lower input costs; all others are paying moreâ€”indicating ubiquitous supplyâ€chain strain.This means that despite Fed tightening, inputâ€cost inflation remains entrenched. A Prices Paid index above 60% historically maps to PPI increases well above target and eventually prints into CPI. And this is strongly against rate cuts. And the margin squeeze, that firms face shrinking margins unless they pass costs onto consumers, in a slowing economy, increasing stagflation. Sharp inputâ€price spikes often precede equity pullbacks and Treasury sellâ€offs, as investors reprice Fedâ€cut odds downwardâ€”heightening the risk of â€œsellâ€theâ€factâ€ moves around FOMC and tariffâ€decision events.Plus add, that major portsâ€”led by Los Angelesâ€”are seeing 30â€“35% plunges in China cargo volumes, freight cancellations have surged, and retail inventories, while temporarily elevated, will run down over a 6â€“8-week buffer. Localized stockouts are already surfacing, but widespread empty shelves are expected within the next week unless shipments reboundâ€”a scenario rendered unlikely without a rapid tariff resolution.So, emptyâ€shelf shortages have not yet fully materialized, but the supply buildup from stockpiling has masked the sudden drop in imports, setting the stage for visible out-of-stocks by around May 10. And this will lift wholesale prices and compress retailer margins, eventually spilling into CPI data.Fed MUST  wait for the true tariff-shock recession and supply-shock inflation to appear in hard data, in order to decide what to do next QT or QE. Watch retail and logistics stocks as early indicators; a sudden uptick in inventory write-downs or guidance cuts will be a red flag that empty-shelf pain is surfacing.The summer liquidity crisis prediction is getting stronger. Plus, US/CN relationship doesnâ€™t look good at allâ€¦Plus, this is ECB day, that I marked many times during April as a risk event, but not only that. Thereâ€™s something very important that many missesâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

The rest was cooler. October roughly -105k and November +64k that is about -41k net over two months, that supports Fed pivot.As said, market sentiment is bad news are good news, meaning market does not have any growth scare now, they welcome any slowdown as it gives room and forces fed to stimulate the economy, exactly what the admin wants. I keep saying this since summerâ€¦ SubscribeMarket is testing the gap. In yesterday chat I said, gap fill will most likely happen on NFP day. Overnight futs have touched the area, but ideally we should see a proper retest, otherwise it is like market is climing in thin air. It needs to have a ground below itself to have stability. For now a retest + rangebound would be ideal. I tell you whyâ€¦If you look at the market returns, you can see that on a rolling one monthly basis market keeps underperforming its 6-months rolling retursn since Sept 2. Thats exactly the downside target since the post-Sept OpEx window of risk call, thats the most liquid and strongest area of the market right now. However, the returns can keep up if market rangebounds. As this market runs like a mathematical simulation of old-school boys, this hidden divergence could be reset.CPI is still ahead, futures did not went crazy on this data release, simply because NFP is not convincing. Letâ€™s not forget that Powell said payroll gains had averaged about +40k/month since April, but that the Fed thinks thereâ€™s an overstatement of about ~60k/month in those payroll numbersâ€”implying the â€œtrueâ€ pace could be around -20k/month.If gap fill fails and sentiment shifts, market would retest that area. Low chance, but non-zero. Keep this in mind.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisBitcoin analysis for the next 5 yearsInvestment, Cryptomarket cycle breakdownDec 03, 2025âˆ™ Paid3314ShareAs you know, I donâ€™t do short-term speculative trades with Bitcoin. The main reason is that its fundamentals are not well defined yet, and its trend is much slower than that of the stock market. This may sound strange given the difference in their volatilities, but if you watch BTC, what it mostly does is one big, sharp move toward a target, followed by a multi-week range-bound consolidation there. SubscribeRight now Iâ€™m scaling down part of my BTC exposure in my portfolio, because in the future, once it reaches my target level, I want to use those profits to increase Bitcoinâ€™s weight to 10%, maybe even higher. The fundamentals of Bitcoin, together with those of the equity market, are going to change, and thatâ€™s why I plan to treat Bitcoin as an investment going forward, rather than as a well-paying, long-term, high-risk speculative trade. The reason is that the stock market is intended to be integrated into the blockchain. When it happens, its risk will still be overestimated.

Market analysisBonds, Currency market, Sentiment, Education and Study on Crises, Weekly post (21-25/April)And leaked infos at the endApr 20, 2025âˆ™ Paid3457ShareOn Friday, I shared an extended study of the current geopolitical situation and the processes that led us here. Itâ€™s crucial to understand this context, because the global economyâ€”and therefore the entire market structureâ€”is undergoing a profound transformation, and every market reaction today is driven first and foremost by the headlines.Last week, I also showed you that the eurozone is headed for stagflation, and that the OpEx would provide supportive flowsâ€”preventing the market from falling and volatility from spiking. Short vol, long theta positions had the edge, as I saidâ€¦Based on my Friday geopolitical study, itâ€™s important to notice that over the past week the SPX didnâ€™t budge on any of the USâ€“China positive processes tweeted by American politicians. Thatâ€™s because investors simply arenâ€™t buying the narrative right now: they react to concrete actions, not tweets or promises. You can see it in commodity marketsâ€”grain, soy, rare earthsâ€”where China is clearly signaling that itâ€™s preparing for a prolonged confrontation and ready to challenge US hegemony. Iâ€™ve been saying since February that the bottom confirmation will only come with a ceaseâ€‘fire and the start of sustainable US QE, likely around June.Right now, investors are pulling money out of US equities; upcoming earnings (TSLA, GOOG this week) will be weak, and the retail â€œbuyâ€‘theâ€‘dipâ€ crowd will lose its support. Trump and Xi are striving to resolve their dispute, but if Trump isnâ€™t bluffingâ€”despite my doubtsâ€”he risks losing his leverage over Taiwan, allowing China to take it without firing a shot. That would be a massive blow to US prestige and economy and a huge gain for China. Thatâ€™s why I keep warning: the risk/reward isnâ€™t in Trumpâ€™s favor; heâ€™s either a hero or a zero. Itâ€™s the most dangerous game. I know many of you are eager to dive into fourthâ€‘order greeks and volâ€‘ofâ€‘volâ€‘ofâ€‘volâ€‘ofâ€‘vol and other fancy non-linear quant stuffs, but one must start with macro, then drill down to micro. In todayâ€™s environment, macro leads the dance.Our job is to monitor headlines in context and watch how the markets reactâ€”first bonds, currency market, then equities. We need to monitor USD/JPY, USD/CNY, as well as the MOVE index and the U.S. Treasuries market to gauge actual headline-reactions. Equities arenâ€™t the focus right now. Below, Iâ€™ll share a brief study of the currency and bond markets during a crisis. Take your time.The Fed is quietly running a slow, hidden QE to support the market. If realized volatility begins to track implied volatility and systematic flows (such as CTAs and volatilityâ€‘control strategies) enter the market, we may begin to see more sustained support. Remember, hidden QEâ€™s sole purpose is to prevent a deflationary spiral; it wonâ€™t restore investor confidence. And the most important thing: investors know this!

Market analysisBreaking down Trump's post | Another IC day - Intraday post (24/Dec)Dec 24, 2025âˆ™ Paid1212ShareHalf-day today!Weekly post: GDP Release - Weekly post (22-26/Dec) [FREE post]AlmaÂ·December 20, 2025Read full storyThe dice are loadedYesterday the GDP and PCE datas came out how I expected: inflationary tendencies (re-accelerating actually) and â€˜GDP upâ€™, and deficit remains but it decreased a bit, while investment also decreased. Market indeed started to reprice Fed cut expectations.In the weekly post, I said, that the release will be an important sentiment-check on the mid-run. In the premarket post, I marked that it seems like, they want to hold the market up:1) on Monday close, the SPX/yields beta went up towards zero. It didnâ€™t go positive, but it flattened the market reaction;2) we had an IC 10x times the trade size of the average position sizes, that was set just right at pivots where long downside vol positions had convexities;These two in themselves dampened the initial market reaction that was a 15 pts sell in futures, and then forced algos to bid on delta right at the open.  In regards of the weekly post, this is a discrepancy of what the market expected for the week. This is where the edge lies, because:1) If the market behaves as it is expected, then it is an easy play, sentiment remains in check, volatility remains controlled, even if the expectations are negative;2) If the market moves more above the expectations, then the sentiment is out of control (more bearish/bullish), reinforcing the trend;3) If the market divergences from the initial expectations, thats the strongest signal, because that also means that the initial positioning must be shifted providing mechanical support too. However, the trend must be confirmed!Now, Friday will be the tell if the GDP reaction was an actual shift in sentiment (even if forced) or just the temporal product of IC and mechanical flows solely on a thin tape.SubscribeAfter all these, Trump posted: This post felt literally just like if he would have answered to my last two posts I dropped during the weekendâ€¦There are some small fibs about trade deficit, investments and inflation, but the core message aligns with my â€œBessent putâ€ thesis I just wrote about few days ago, that they are about to reshape the reaction function to the economy. Trump claims that in good old days, markets were rallied on good news. Depends on what he meant by â€œold daysâ€: after the dotcom bubble, it was net true until 2020, however before 90s it was exactly the opposite. As long as core inflation remains above target, market doesnâ€™t like â€˜good newsâ€™â€¦ ot it should not doâ€¦However what Trump promises by this post is that they will rig the game even more fundamentaly in order to keep the markets up. UK and US both did something similar in the 70s, and also Turkey did so two years ago driving their economy into a hyperinflation. All of these ended up in forced tightenings after.Whatâ€™s the purpose? Well, if you get GDP up/prices up and policymakers still try to push easier conditions, the best case is a â€œfinancial repressionâ€ with lower real rates that erode the real burden of debt, but at the cost of higher inflation volatility and distortions.However there is a risk that long-end yields still rise, and so debt service can worsen. And this is were the Bessent-put comes into playâ€¦They expand long-end buyback operations and aim to keep vol low. But this will keep inflation sticky again. This tells me that Trump wants to bring back the post-WW2 â€œyield curve controlâ€ scheme later.The Fed implemented a form of yield-curve targeting, capping rates at multiple maturities (famously ~2.5% on long bonds). This made mortgages, corporate loans, and other investments cheaper, stimulating the economy.The market rallied like ~135% from 1942 to 1951 March, when they unwound this regime. Because once inflation pressures rise, holding down long yields can require balance-sheet expansion and/or regulation-like controls, which can undermine credibility and create an eventual break. Now, you can see a three-years long bearmarket started in 1946 May.This was because of sharp reflation after price controls were eliminated. As a result of YCC, bill yields pegged at 0.375% and the long bond capped at 2.5%, with the Fed having to buy securities to defend the structure if markets didnâ€™t want to hold them at those yields. Now, even if nominal yields were anchored, real yields could become sharply negative during the inflation spike, creating a noisy valuation environment.Later, as inflation expectations persisted, Fed went for tightening in 1948, and the economy entered its first postwar recession in Nov of 1948, and then the cycle reset. We have however this AI-boom too, that is supportive only if the developments deliver real productivity, shifting the environment towards positive supply-side shock. But the risk is high that the AI is demand today but wonâ€™t become a supply tomorrow. Debt/GDP could look better in nominal terms, but productivity would be lower and capital allocation would degrade. And this would produce a very similar or â€œrhymingâ€ pattern of what happened in the last century. On the short-runThis will hold up the markets artificially and win the mid-term elections at any cost.The game is rigged, I donâ€™t consider it as a good investing environment into risk assets, nor for longer-term trades. Iâ€™m scaling out of some longer-term positions, took profit from Nov 20 longs, and will take new ones only if a pullback happens, potentially around spring. In my â€œplaying the AI bubble postâ€ I marked 8k+ target as max for the cycle under Trump. I will refresh this post soon. As the market is rigged, I do not play any downside, as I keep emphatizing. When I see risk, I hedge volatility solely, not spot direction. I use the dips to take long positions, but I see no edge in shorting, not because it canâ€™t go down, but because the market is heavily manipulated towards teh upside until reality hits. But not nowâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisBullish momentum? + Intraday post (29/May) May 29, 2025âˆ™ Paid83ShareIt seems like my bias for a grind up into June OpEx is materializing. Picture is clearing out.We saw a 200-point pullback last week (as predicted) and vol selling fueled by Bessentâ€™s manipulation (also predicted). My reversion model now suggests over a 79% probability of a reversionâ€”another buy-the-dip opportunity, just like the last one, as I keep emphasizing.Yesterday I broke it down how Bessent is planing to create a supportive, pseudo-QE feedback loop for the markets. It is happening.Bessent has proposed reducing the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for banks to encourage increased holdings of U.S. Treasuries, aiming to lower long-term yields and stimulate economic growth.

# Bulltrap? VIX, Trump, Structure breakdown + Intraday post (05/Aug)

Market analysisBulltrap? VIX, Trump, Structure breakdown + Intraday post (05/Aug)Aug 05, 2025âˆ™ Paid142ShareMonthly-weekly post: Monthly outlook into Aug - Sept window + Weekly post (04/Aug - 08/Aug)AlmaÂ·August 3, 2025Read full storyIn yesterday post, I warned you that the downside move is not yet proved technically, and called for right-tail and bull-trap bet that will materialize if the SPX is strong above a certain line. It opened above that, it got vacuumed up, and I updated the levels in the chat. After the session, we discussed the significance of the term â€˜bull-trapâ€™. Read this thread, pleaseâ€¦There are two things, we need to scrutinize today. The first is, the fact that market rallied out of the range that the market were pricing in for the week, and its significance,and the second is, DJ Trumpâ€˜s tweet: Letâ€™s start with DJâ€¦As I said in April and May, I say it again: when the President of the United States posts something like this, you have to seriously consider it. The tweet aligns with my bulltrap call during this week, that me personally expect to be more like a ranging than a rally, but yesterdayâ€™s price action had a significant messageâ€¦But Trumpâ€™s tweets in itself are not a guarantee that the market will go sharply up from now into the infinity. He is a sentiment manipulator! Keep that in mind. In the 2018/2020 period, he tweeted a lot, and most of the times the rallies were insignificant, and sometimes they were just right before a major pullback (was more rarely, but it happened). So, it is not an indicator for anything. One example:In my monthly/weekly post, I told you that they will manage the volatility, and wonâ€™t let the market to expand too big. Also said, that positioning says that volatility will be suppressed for this week, and vol of vol is gonna be managed during the month, in order to avoid sharp rebalances in VCs and CTAsâ€¦)This means, they are working hard to prevent a black-swan, but to create a slow sell, in order to make the Fed fold is strategical, this is why monitoring Fedâ€™s stance is crucial. But as said, the problem is not solely the rates and looming contraction, but also the looming geopolitical problems and inland political tensions in the US. My next risk target for volatility leg-up remains the Friday-to-OpEx week window, especially the weekend (most geo stuffs are timed into weekends in order to get a hard time to catch the move). Note, that the rate cut bets spiked on the labour market datas, even tho it is not what the Fed wants to see for a cut; market is too complacentâ€¦ We have PMI today, and CPI next week, and if disinflation trend is not proved, that 88.2% will get washed out of the markets. Listen, structurallyâ€¦the volume is low. The lift that occured before the drop (especially in the tech sector) got taken back just within 2 days. The spot is testing the upper bound of the channel. This is pivotal, because the channel is the no-mans-land (imagine this channel more like a 2-dimensional trendline!).Considering Trumpâ€™s tweet, and the fact that market got agressively squeezed out of both the weekly range and the above showed channel, and even despite this, the overnight trend did not take out the upward purple line, is a clear sign for a trappish setup. I repeat: I expect the trap to materialize during the week. Mostly in a form of ranging, but Trumpâ€™s tweet even poses the possibility for a double top. I donâ€™t know... All I know is that below 6416.01 (and even with an avg 5 days price of this), the market is heading towards equilibrium from where negative returns will starts to get accumulated. But in order to avoid a black-swan, sentiment must be calmed.I took shorts in the range of the blow-off top target and fakeout target during the last week, took decent profit, and now playing the trap and will add to shorts in small size at key upside levels (mostly spreads to mitigate the cost). Hedges (VIX) are still cheap. The range, I laid down in the weekly post is crucial, bcs out of the range upwards, the market bets on a squeeze-up towards 25s.This is a day-by-day week for both swing traders and daytradersâ€¦ SubscribeLetâ€™s look at todayâ€™s positioningâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Central Banks, Tariffs, Market (Weekly post 07-11/April)

Market analysisCentral Banks, Tariffs, Market (Weekly post 07-11/April)Apr 06, 2025âˆ™ Paid4366ShareBefore we dive inâ€¦Geopolitical context,Tariff war, World re-polarization, from off-shore to friend-shore,Emerging deflationary concerns on the horizont.CDS Index: Gold Futures: I canâ€™t stress enough that the market not only hasnâ€™t come out of the woods yet, it has only just entered it.We reached a bottom here, and weâ€™ll see vol selling to brake that car on the icy road. In this environment, any not-bad news is good news. But the underlying trend is still bearish until fiscal and negotiation outcomes change the picture.Trump wants to push through tax cuts and a debt ceiling increase; if they fail, the U.S. is likely to plunge into a quick recession. But the elite and the banks and funds have every tool to bail the economy out. As I keep saying, the real reason behind the tariffs is that Trumpâ€™s strategy is to force the EU and other affected nations to the negotiation table. Some countries have already started negotiating. And with Klaus Schwab stepping aside, there may be an opportunity for a reformed approachâ€”one that might be ready to engage with the U.S. on more favorable terms, as part of a broader realignment that acknowledges the limits of pure globalization.(Schwab was a long-time symbol of the globalist eliteâ€”the network of business and policy leaders who traditionally guided global economic policy and multilateral cooperation. With this move, the globalist elite, recognizing the need to adapt to a new reality, might be more willing to consider U.S. proposals that align with the current economic and geopolitical landscape.)The current situation requires a lot of patience, because these events all hinge on the decisions of leaders. Predicting them in advance isnâ€™t worthwhileâ€”it can create unnecessary bias. Here, we must watch, wait, and adapt.This is what Powell said on Friday. Doesnâ€™t it sounds familiar? (hint: my premarket post)And what did Trump say? Letâ€™s break it downâ€¦The new tit-for-tat â€œtariff warâ€ initiated by the U.S. is reshuffling the global trade deck. Letâ€™s first identify which countries and sectors are most exposed to the U.S. trade balance and thus in the crosshairs of tariff policy, and how they are responding.China is by far the largest source of the U.S. trade deficit (goods deficit with China was about $350-400 billion per year pre-tariffs), China is the prime target. The U.S. tariffs (now averaging 34% on Chinese good) hit electronics, machinery, furniture, and other consumer products. Chinaâ€™s exposure to U.S. demand is significant â€“ around 18% of Chinaâ€™s goods exports went to the U.S. pre-tariff. The immediate impact is disruption of supply chains. Multinational companies with factories in China (toys, apparel, consumer electronics) are scrambling to reroute orders to other Asian countries or domestically in the U.S./Mexico. As a result, beneficiaries include Vietnam, Mexico, and other Southeast Asian nations which can supply similar goods. Indeed, even before this escalation, Vietnam and India saw rising U.S. imports as firms â€œChina+1â€ strategy took hold. Now that will accelerate. However, as CSIS notes, the scale and scope of Trumpâ€™s new tariffs exceeded expectations â€“ he didnâ€™t stop at China. NAFTA (now USMCA) partners traditionally enjoy tariff-free access to the U.S. market. But Trump invoked a â€œreciprocal tariffâ€ doctrine even on allies â€“ threatening 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for any sectors where they impose barriers. Specifically, he complained about Canadaâ€™s dairy protections and Mexicoâ€™s auto rules. This is politically sensitive because USMCA is in force. Mexican officials have warned that U.S. tariffs violate the agreement and have prepared retaliatory tariffs on U.S. corn and machinery if enacted. Mexico is highly exposed: itâ€™s the U.S.â€™s second-largest trading partner, with a deficit of around $130B. Sectors at stake: autos and auto parts (huge cross-border industry), electronics, appliances, and agriculture (Mexico imports a lot of U.S. grain, and exports vegetables and beer). So far, Trump gave a short reprieve to USMCA partners to negotiate. The hope is heâ€™s using the threat as leverage to force, say, more U.S. content in autos or a sunset clause renegotiation. If he actually slapped tariffs, it would be economically damaging to border states and U.S. companies integrated with Mexico. Thus, we may see intense negotiations where Mexico perhaps agrees to quotas or voluntary export restraints in some sectors to appease Trump. Canada, too, may make concessions (e.g. further opening its dairy market, as it partially did in USMCA). The â€œcoalition of the willingâ€ in trade might ironically be U.S. neighbors trying to appease U.S. demands. Canadian and Mexican leaders are also coordinating with the EU and Asia to form a united front at the WTO, but the WTOâ€™s Appellate Body is defunct (partly due to U.S. blocking), limiting legal recourse.The EU as a whole runs a trade surplus with the U.S. (~$200B in goods, partly offset by a U.S. surplus in services). Germany is a major contributor via cars and machinery. The new U.S. tariffs hit European autos with a 10% duty (since the EU has a 10% tariff on U.S. cars, Trump mirrored it â€“ â€œreciprocalâ€) and steel/aluminum with 10% (again citing existing EU tariffs). The EU swiftly announced it would â€œgive as good as it getsâ€ with proportionate tariffs. Brussels targeted iconic American exports like Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon, and even iPhones (the $2,300 iPhone quip â€“ thatâ€™s an estimate of future cost if all tariffs fully applied). Europeâ€™s strategy is twofold: retaliate to pressure the U.S. politically, but also seek dialogue. EU Trade Commissioner has flown to Washington to propose a plurilateral forum on tariff reduction, trying to coax the U.S. back to a negotiated solution. Both Japan and South Korea have large trade surpluses with the U.S. in automobiles, electronics, etc. Japanâ€™s surplus (~$70B) has long irked Trump. He revived talk of a 25% auto tariff, which would hit Toyota, Honda, etc. Japan is extremely exposed in autos â€“ millions of cars exported. However, Japanâ€™s strategy is to emphasize its investments in U.S. factories (many Japanese carmakers build in America, employing tens of thousands). South Korea renegotiated KORUS FTA with Trump in 2018 to avoid tariffs by limiting steel exports and opening auto quotas. Theyâ€™ll likely abide by those terms and hope to dodge new tariffs. Both Japan and Korea are also key players in semiconductor and battery supply chains â€“ ironically, sectors the U.S. wants to secure. So tariffs there could be self-defeating. We might see sectoral exemptions â€“ e.g. rare earths, EV batteries, etc., might be spared due to strategic importance.Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia have seen surging exports to the U.S., partly taking share from China. Vietnam now has a >$100B surplus with the U.S., making it potentially the next target. The U.S. has already labeled Vietnam a currency manipulator in the past. However, Vietnam is a linchpin of U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy â€“ itâ€™s a communist country but leans toward the U.S. to counter China.  The pattern could be: hammer China publicly, quietly negotiate with Vietnam/others to not let them become too big of conduits for Chinese goods. Countries like Vietnam and Malaysia will attempt to comply with rules of origin, to show they arenâ€™t just repackaging Chinese products. If they succeed, they gain as trade diverts to them. If the U.S. also targets them, then the whole global trade pie shrinks substantially (a true Smoot-Hawley scenario).Some countries run deficits with the U.S. (meaning U.S. has surplus). They include UK, Netherlands (due to services and trans-shipments), and some in Latin America. Those countries are less exposed to tariffs, but more exposed to slowdown in U.S. demand. For example, if U.S. consumers pay more for tariffs, they may import less from everywhere, not just tariffed countries. So even nations not directly hit by tariffs might suffer collateral export declines.We also see a quickening of the â€œreconfiguration of supply chainsâ€ that began with Covid-19 and U.S.-China economic cold war tensions. Thereâ€™s a push for â€œfriend-shoringâ€ â€“ sourcing from countries deemed friendly to the U.S. (like Mexico, or maybe India). Southeast Asia stands to benefit: Thailand might get more electronics assembly, Indonesia more furniture/textile orders, etc. U.S. domestic manufacturing could see a boost in certain sectors (steel, perhaps semiconductors with CHIPS Act support, etc.), but capacity constraints and higher costs mean it canâ€™t replace Asia overnight.One sector to watch is agriculture. Chinaâ€™s retaliation so far focused on manufactured goods tariffs, but if it extends to U.S. agriculture (like soybeans as in 2018), it could hurt U.S. farmers and cause trade diversion to Brazil/Argentina for soy, or Australia for grains. On April 4, China did announce tariffs on all U.S. goods including agri, which implies U.S. farmers will indeed face losses as Chinese buyers shift to South America. That puts political pressure on Trump from farm states, which might force some compromise or subsidies to farmers (like the aid given in 2019 trade war). The Fed is a bit behind the ECB in dovish pivot but is moving that way. Powellâ€™s comments acknowledging tariffsâ€™ impact on inflation and growth show a balanced view. The Fedâ€™s reaction function now weights financial conditions more because the banking system had a scare in 2023 (Silicon Valley Bank and others). The Fed doesnâ€™t want to inadvertently trigger more bank failures or market crashes by overtightening. The tariffs complicate their job: they could add maybe 0.5% to headline inflation later in 2025 (if companies pass costs on), but also subtract perhaps 1% from GDP over 2 years (as global trade shrinks). The bond market is betting the Fed chooses to support growth (cut rates) rather than fight a one-off inflation blip. We can expect the Fed start cutting by Q3 2025. It will also use tools to ensure liquidity â€“ e.g. extending the BTFP (which lends to banks against bonds at par, essentially QE-like support). The Fedâ€™s big concern is un-anchored inflation expectations, but so far long-run inflation expectations have remained around 2-2.5% (helped by the credibility they built). The ECBâ€™s typical reflex (as seen) is early easing on growth fears. The ECB has explicitly said a trade war is a big downside risk and that inflation from tariffs will likely be short-lived, whereas the growth hit could be lasting. That gives them cover to cut rates without worrying they are betraying their inflation mandate â€“ because they expect inflation will actually fall after an initial import cost bump (due to recessionary forces). We saw multiple ECB officials make the case for cuts in March. We anticipate the ECB will announce at least a 25 bp rate cut in May, and possibly signal more to come, reversing course from tightening. Additionally, the ECB might revive some form of asset purchases if credit spreads blow out. There is precedent: in 2019, after trade tensions and weak industry data, Draghi guided rate cuts and restarted QE. This time, Christine Lagarde (ECB President) has warned tariffs â€œunsettle the trade world as we know itâ€ and could have global spillovers. The ECB is coordinating with other central banks â€“ for example, currency swap lines to ensure euro/dollar liquidity. Behaviorally, the ECBâ€™s early hints are meant to shore up confidence (a forward guidance tool) â€“ by saying â€œwe stand ready to actâ€, they hope to prevent a credit crunch in advance. American and European left-wing economic circles argue central banks should not overreact to supply-side inflation at the cost of jobs (they cheered the idea of Fedâ€™s average inflation targeting which tolerates overshoots). They currently would say: â€˜Donâ€™t repeat the errors of the past; the bigger threat is a downturn and financial instability, not a second wave of inflationâ€™. On the right-wing side, especially among some German and U.S. conservatives, there is concern that easing too soon will entrench higher inflation and punish savers, and that central banks might be yielding to political pressure. A dovish ECB would be interpreted as weakness that Trump could exploit.An early ECB cut would support the idea that European nations are willing to compromise for short-term relief. That, in turn, creates a window for Trump to put Europe on the negotiation tableâ€”using the promise of stabilization as leverage for tax cuts or debt ceiling adjustments in the U.S.If Europe shows signs of sticking to high rates despite the trade war rather than easing, then that rigidity can actually worsen market sentiment.Chinaâ€™s response to tariffs is domestic stimulus â€“ the PBoC has cut bank reserve requirement ratios (RRR) and even trimmed policy interest rates to spur lending. It is also guiding banks to keep credit flowing to small exporters hurt by tariffs. The PBoC and Chinaâ€™s state banks may also intervene to steady the yuan if needed, dipping into their $3T reserve war chest. By easing policy, China actually contributes to global liquidity (a more accommodative stance can leak out via increased imports from neighbors, less competition for global capital, etc.). If China were to tighten in the face of tariffs (which it wonâ€™t), that would be pro-cyclical and worsen things. Instead, China is explicitly focusing on stimulus and strengthening ties with alternative trading partners, effectively taking a different route than confrontation â€“ a rational response to mitigate damage. The BoJ is an interesting case. It has been under pressure to normalize policy given that Japan finally saw inflation above 2%. However, global turmoil gives it cover to delay any tightening. In April 2025, the BoJ left its yield curve control in place (10-year JGB yield cap ~1%) and policy rate negative, noting it did not want to contribute to global market stress. Governor Ueda hinted that while domestic conditions might have justified some tightening, the external environment is too risky â€“ essentially a â€œpauseâ€ citing global uncertainty (likely referencing the yen carry unwinds and financial volatility). If the yen surges too much (carry unwind), the BoJ might even intervene (as it did in 2022) to smooth FX moves. But so far, yen strengthening is a natural stabilizer â€“ it tightens Japanâ€™s financial conditions a bit (which the BoJ might quietly welcome to tame import inflation) but not too dramatically yet. The BoJ also provides a stabilizing influence by continuing asset purchases; Japanese investors, faced with domestic caps, will still invest abroad (once volatility settles), providing some support to global markets. In a behavioral sense, the BoJ has been the anchor of low rates â€“ as long as it stays put, some investors will continue to engage in carry trades (perhaps shifting to other funding currencies like euro or Swiss franc if yen is less favorable due to volatility).Trumpâ€™s deliberate use of manufactured chaos â€“ from debt-ceiling brinkmanship to tariff salvos â€“ has created a highly fluid situation. This chaos is a negotiating tactic to keep opponents off-balance and force reactive moves. As weâ€™ve seen, markets and central banks form a reactive feedback loop to these shocks. Trumpâ€™s threats (whether default or trade war) spook markets, markets sell off, then policymakers (e.g. the Fed, ECB) respond to stabilize conditions, which in turn can embolden further aggressive bargaining. Itâ€™s a high-stakes game of chicken.Leading indicators like credit spreads, equity volatility, and PMI surveys become as important to watch as official GDP or CPI releases. If credit spreads start narrowing and equities stabilizing, central banks may feel less urgency to ease aggressively. If, on the other hand, we saw something like a funding strain (LIBOR/OIS spread widening, or a major bank in trouble), policymakers would intervene swiftly (as they did in March 2023 with bank backstops).The German â€œregime shiftâ€ on fiscal policy â€“ overturning decades of austerity â€“ is a game-changer for Europe, and it flew under many investorsâ€™ radar because headlines were dominated by U.S.-China drama. But this unlocks hundreds of billions of Euros for investment. Strategically, this means Europe could become a relative bright spot in global demand late in 2025 and 2026, just as the U.S. perhaps slows under trade pressures. A well-capitalized European defense and infrastructure push can create jobs and profits within Europe. For investors, European equities (particularly industrials, construction, defense companies) may have a more solid fundamental backing now â€“ a structural trend that could outlast the current turmoil. Right-wing European commentators (and some on Wall Street) cheer this as belated but welcome, arguing Europe needs fiscal expansion to share the burden long shouldered by monetary policy. Left-wing voices in Europe also support the investment (especially in green infrastructure), though they urge that it be directed to inclusive growth. From a macro strategy angle, Europeâ€™s fiscal loosening combined with the ECBâ€™s likely easing is a bullish mix for European assets, although partly priced in after the relative outperformance noted in Q1. A risk to monitor is if bond markets question debt sustainability â€“ so far thatâ€™s in check, but if German yields keep rising with big issuance, the ECB may need to tacitly cap yields (possibly via its existing tools like the TPI backstop for Italy).This is a very important precursor of a potential change.

Market analysisChallenges for 2026 | Weekly post (05 - 09/Jan)Jan 04, 2026âˆ™ Paid2222ShareYearly outlook, challenges for teh western economy: The challenges of 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 5Read full storyReversion model flags 6,889.84 as the level that must hold for the rally to extend. There is no excessive short-term momentum on the horizon.On a multi-year basis, however, the model shows a 92.81% probability of a mean reversion below 6,000. In backtests, I typically need 95%+ to call a high-conviction topping signal, but this reading already helps explain why investors are in â€œsell-into-strengthâ€ mode.(These signals appeared in 2019, 2020, 2022, and again in 2025 ahead of the April crash)What I expect next is a time correction: a wider, range-bound regime and liquidity hunting into the FOMC, to cool off the mechanical risk metrics. SubscribeGeopoliticsI previously highlighted the risk around the Venezuelan situation. By moving to apprehend Maduroâ€”a Russia- and China-aligned dictatorâ€”the U.S. is pushing back against de-dollarization, since the bulk of global oil trade is conducted in dollars, and it can also secure more durable control over global oil supply. That reduces dependence on Middle Eastern OPEC producers and allows oil pricesâ€”and therefore inflationâ€”to be influenced, especially to offset the impact of tariffs.This also contributes to managing the debt burden: the U.S. can borrow cheaply in its own currency because international reserve demand supports the dollar and helps keep U.S. Treasury yields lowerâ€”what Giscard dâ€™Estaing called the â€œexorbitant privilege.â€ In the short term, the market can plausibly expect fiscal support and then monetary support; in the long term, however, this is problematic.China will not ignore this geopolitical realignment, so the geopolitical risk premium remains elevated.Market riskRisk appetite among speculators is above 85%, which is extremely high. Leverage is at record highs, while rotation across the market remains slow.Roughly 40% of market momentum is coming from AI-linked equities. These names are materially overvalued because there is oversupply in AI infrastructure, which continuously depreciates, and much of the capex will not earn an adequate return. This is being masked through various accounting tricks. Companies are funding excessive spending with credit, which is a time bomb for the economy because these assets erode over time. That will ultimately force both the Fed and the government back toward stimulusâ€”adding further inflationary pressure. But more on that in another postâ€¦The short VIX trade is crowded, which builds meaningful vomma risk over the longer run.Meanwhile, the government publishes only narrative-consistent, cosmetically adjusted economic data, even though in reality people are paying more for less valueâ€”stagflation remains a feature. SubscribeMicrostructureRetail investors will likely remain important drivers of liquidity and price discovery. This is supported by the fact that in 2025 household net worth and equity exposure grew to record highs, alongside leverage, which reinforces BTD and FOMO behavior over the medium term.Large institutional investors are steadily increasing allocations to low-risk assets. This is a hidden short-speed position: we should not expect strong long-squeeze dynamics in a selloff, but it leaves them with more capacity to step in during drawdowns.Rotation is not only occurring at the index level, but also across sectors. Some capital is moving into value and cyclical names. By late 2025, previously lagging segmentsâ€”such as energy and industrialsâ€”remain underrepresented in market cap despite improving fundamentals. If those fundamentals continue to improve, these sectors can gain a larger share of the overall market, and there are already signs that investors are beginning to reallocate in that direction.This temporarily reduces concentration risk, while we can still expect expansion in tech to be framed positively.Overall, supportive forces are still present, but the market needs more room to grow and must keep the bullish narrative alive. I expect more meaningful weakness into spring; until then, the base case is rotation and range-bound trade. This market favors speculators more than investors, and long-term risk remains very high.

I explained that the â€œbulltrapâ€ bias comes from the overconfidency about Sept cuts and looming geo risk. And after the market squeezed through the weekly range that the market was pricing in before Sunday open, and Trump tweeted, I wrote that the momentum can be extended, and one should take it serious, provided VIX range with heavy squeeze-risk, and said that until SPX cannot perform 6412 in a weekly avg, market is heading towards equilibrium: Bulltrap? VIX, Trump, Structure breakdown + Intraday post (05/Aug)AlmaÂ·August 5, 2025Read full storyToday this number is 6466.71 The message was basically to not be married to any side, because none of the trends are confirmed, and the Sept cut is hyped on only the NFP datas, that is not enough. Trump wants cut in order to unlock MMF money. Donâ€™t chase here any side, just trade the upward move and the range patiently and wait until the risk settles or materializes. Vomma is sold, vanna is bid, so is speed while sentiment is still hyped. The market underprices the risk of inflation. The core inflation can be expected around +0.33% m/m and 3% y/y as the tariff effects start to appear in the datas, there is less immigrant and the global economy order is changing, while new taxes increase cost-push inflation, and also dollar keeps weakening:While it favors for exports and to inflate debt away, lower rates would weaken DXY more pushing inflation higher. And there were further heavy outflows from equities towards MMFs. SubscribeWe are knew that Trump wants weak dollar, low immigration, low yields, tax on imports, and also higher tech concentration. This is what the whole past-year Trump trade was all about. I wrote about it in my longer-term outlook. Everybody knew that this is inflationary. Then what is the problem? Growth and debt burden. Stagflation.Softening growth tempers pricing power, and market prices a 2.4-2.5% 5yr breakeven, a sticky inflationary pressure. Lower rates could ease debt service, support asset prices and draw some cash out of MMFs (even tho that money would mostly flow into bonds to lock high yield coupons first). But inflation is high even without tariffs. A logical move would be some upside correction in the dollar and the artificially prevented reversion in the markets to ease inflation pressures even on paper. So, Trump could blame Powell for that and push the Fed for a Sept cut.We will seeâ€¦ Letâ€™s look at what the market is pricing inâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisCPI, credit spreads, Stagflation, QT + Intraday post (13/May)SPX/LTY correlation, Yields, Credit spreads, CPI, Stagflation, Intraday postMay 13, 2025âˆ™ Paid2212ShareTrumpâ€™s landed in Saudi. This is a pivotal event. Meanwhile the White House is weighing a deal to export hundreds of thousands of U.S. AI-grade chips to G42, a UAE AI championâ€”an unprecedented pivot in export controls. Signaling that geopolitical lines around technology are fluid, injecting fresh uncertainty into semis and tech valuations. Potentially broadening chip supply could ease tech-hardware inflation pressureâ€”but may provoke pushback if national-security concerns rise. This is what Iâ€™m keep saying, that the stagflationary pressures can be eased, and economy can be bailed out if good deals are done. But the final boss is China. DYNAMICS1) SPX/LTY correlationEquityâ€“yields correlation has jumped to ~70 bps over the past week (from -22% to 52%), signaling that inflation surprises (and hence inflation expectations) have become the primary driver of both yields and equity returns, rather than growth surprises. This abrupt flip resembles the mid-2021 shift documented by the BIS: once inflation is volatile enough, positive correlations persist and diversification benefits fade. Crucial, because the stockâ€“bond correlation depends not on the level of inflation per se but on the relative volatility of growth vs. inflation surprises and their covariance. When inflation uncertainty rises, its shocks loom larger, flipping correlations positive and eroding bondsâ€™ hedge role. With equities and bonds moving together, passive portfolios demand extra compensation for undiversified bond risk, pushing term premiaâ€”and long yieldsâ€”higher over time.CPI expectations remain elevated above the Fedâ€™s 2% goal: April headline is seen at +0.2% m/m (2.4% y/y), core at +0.3% m/m (2.8% y/y), with currentâ€quarter annualized CPI â‰ˆ 3.0%, yearâ€ahead consumer survey at 3.6%, and 5-year breakevens near 2.39%So, basically consensus forecasts expect the April CPI to show inflation was firmer than previously thought, signaling that price pressures remain sticky and complicating the Fedâ€™s calculus for rate cuts.Below-consensus CPI prints will now tend to lower long yields (bond prices up) and boost equitiesâ€”unlike a growth regime, where yields and stocks would diverge. Good inflation news are good for both. While above-consensus inflation prints push yields up (bond prices down) and dent stocks, creating a one-two punch to multi-asset portfolios. Bad inflation news are bad for both.2) U.S. 10-Year Treasury YieldYields fell below 4.00 % in early April (betting on rapid Fed cuts and tariff relief), then surged back above 4.40 % as the Fed held rates and liquidity tightened. The rebound from 4.00 % to 4.40â€“4.50 % shows markets now price a delayed Fed easing cycleâ€”term premia have widened as fixed-income investors demand extra compensation for holding long bonds in a volatile, policy-driven regime. Breakeven inflation (10-year TIPS spread) stood at 2.29 % on May 9, reflecting that markets still expect inflation near the Fedâ€™s 2 % target over the next decade. With longer spiked SPX to LTY correlation, this means that good inflation news (below-expectation CPI) will now lower yields and lift equitiesâ€”as both bond risk premia and equity discount rates ease; while bad inflation news (above-expectation CPI) will raise yields and hurt stocks in tandem, compressing traditional 60/40 diversification benefits.4.30â€“4.50 % likely holds as long as policy and tariff risks remain front-and-center; a sustained move below 4.20 % would require markedly weaker data or fresh Fed dovish signals.Any surprise in inflation prints or a sudden liquidity squeeze (e.g., repo-market stress) could send yields rapidly through the 4.50 % handleâ€”and rip equity valuations.3) CDX High-Yield 5Y SpreadThe credit-default-swap spread on the 5-year high-yield index spiked from ~300 bps in December to a peak near 476 bps in early April (tariff shock/freight-bottle-neck worry), then retraced to ~350 bps today. Itâ€™s above its 100- and 200-day averagesâ€”indicating that, on balance, credit stress remains elevated vs. long-term norms. But itâ€™s below its 50-day average, suggesting a partial cooldown from the spike but not a return to â€œhealthyâ€ levels.A steep curve in CDS spreads (with shorter tenors widening more) can foreshadow mounting default concerns; the high-yield 5-year contractâ€™s stubborn elevation implies that near-term funding strains are priced into credit protections.Spreads north of both long-run averages demonstrate investors demand extra compensation for tail risks in the high-yield universe. If a fresh catalyst (e.g., hawkish Fed remarks or tariff escalations) hits, we will see renewed stress, since dealers and funds remain underhedged in face of a tighter liquidity backdrop. In a good-news regime, weâ€™d expect spreads to compress back toward long-term averages and equity risk-premia to narrow. In a bad-news regime, spreads would re-widen sharply above short-term trends, denting high-yield debt and equity valuations in tandem.So the key is, that the primary concern has shifted away from recession toward managing inflation risks.Lose-lose for FedAs I kept explaining since April Fed datas, Trumpâ€™s tariff policy forced the Fed into a lose-lose situation of choosing between steering the economy into recession or managing a period of stagflation. At its May 7 meeting, Fed officials unanimously decided to keep the benchmark rate unchanged while cautioning that tariffs posed dual threats of higher unemployment and higher inflation. As Powell said that sustained tariff increases â€œare likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemploymentâ€. Stagflation. Firmer-than-expected CPI readings imply the Fed may hold rates at restrictive levels longer, and any dovish pivot hinges on clear evidence of inflation easing back toward the 2 percent target. Get ready for sharp repricing of both rates and equities, if priceâ€report surprises. VOLATILITY REGIMECoding 1m, 3m realized volatility and vol of vol for SPX: On a monthly basis, RV has fallen down to its 23.36% by May 9, while catched up to 24.90% during yesterday session. However on a three monthly basis, RV is stagnant and grinding up, currently trending at 29.48%The sharp decrease in one monthly RV was simply caused by mathematics, once those four shock days began to roll off a 20-day window (by April 23, T+12; April 24, T+13; etc.), the 1m RV plungedâ€”not because markets calmed, but because the biggest outliers left the sample. A 3m RV has longer memory.Risk-parity, vol-targeting, risk-controlled indices compare the observed RV to a target and scale exposure by min(1, target/RV). Volatility-managed portfolios outperform by de-leveraging in high-vol regimes and increasing leverage when volatility subsides. Until both windows fall below the vol-target threshold, vol-control strategies will remain cautiousâ€”hence minimal fresh buy flows even in the face of a low 1m RV.The real reason is the vol of vol (VoV). Look how much it spikedâ€¦This means that the mean of vol falls while its variance return distribution stays high, signaling fat tails, clustering, and higher sensitivity of risk measures to new shocks, also delta-hedged option returns are systematically negative when exposed to high VoVâ€”investors pay up for the insurance against a volatile volatility regime. (Rough volatility models show that volatility paths are far more jagged than classical diffusionsâ€”implying persistent high VoV even if average vol is low.) There is a lot of mispricing risk here. The takeaway is clear: donâ€™t trust a singleâ€scale vol measure. 1m RV may signal â€œbuyâ€, but VoV and 3m RV still signal â€œsell/neutral.â€ The result: vol-targeters sit on their hands, missing opportunities or being caught off-guard when RV re-spikes.MEAN REVERSIONThe first reversion model, signaling red dot at 5844.18 highs, targeting 5491.06 as the projected â€œcool offâ€ point. 5664.86 is pivot  The model says 67.26% probability for reversion towards 5491.06Size accordingly. The odds are relatively underpricedMay OpEx:Jun OpEx:Based on the VIX at 18.52% as of May 13, 2025, the one-sigma move over the next three trading days (to May 16) is about Â±118 points, corresponding to a 68.2% probability of SPX remaining within that range and 31.8% of ending outside it. The market assigns roughly a 17.3% chance of SPX < 5725 and a 15.7% chance of SPX > 5960 by May 16, as implied by the respective IVs. This aligns with what VIX is showing us, even overestimated by a small 1.2 pts, that is natural and gives a bit more room for short VIX. However, fo June OpEx, the VIX implies a oneâ€sigma move of Â±5.98 % (â‰ˆÂ±349 pts). By June OpEx, risk-neutral odds for SPX < 5495 â‰ˆ 18.5%, and for > 6195 â‰ˆ 8.3%This is an underpricing by 5%; not much but it is there. Note, VIX tends to underestimate the market moves, and these probabilities are derived from VIX. If my model estimates the odds right (usually does), then this is a serious mispricing, and one should monitor carefully how it evolves. Be careful, the divergence arises because the Q-measure strips out the mean-reversion drift and adds a volatility risk premium/skew. What I mean is that mean-reverting processes produce physical probabilities that account for a drift back toward a long-term mean, calibrated to historical data and true-world dynamics, while risk-neutral probabilities are derived from market option prices under an equivalent martingale (Q) measure and ignoring real-world drift in favor of no-arbitrage pricing.The marketâ€™s risk-neutral probabilities understate that physical likelihood by ~40 pp, if my model is right, but no arbitrage opportunity. The subject of this underestimationis coming from several risks. Market has run out of steam after Opex hedging flows, needs to fill key gap levels, is underpinned by rising trade deficits, tight credit/funding conditions, and inflationary supply shocks from tariffs and freight (these shocks push up costs for raw materials, shipping, and finished goodsâ€”even as demand cools, you wonâ€™t see these immediately in headline CPI; they show up first in wholesale prices, margin compression, then eventually feed into consumer prices), and likely to retest or breach prior lows before enough volatility and macro data calm down to rebuild a bullish technical structure.SubscribeINTRADAY POSTCoding todayâ€™s positioning:Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisCPI day as pivot, The Risk of Debt Burden, Fed + Intraday post (15/July)Very important postJul 15, 2025âˆ™ Paid163ShareWeekly postDATA RELEASES, PERSPECTIVEToday, we get the CPI datas. I estimate a stronger report with higher probability, as YoY rates near multiâ€‘month highs and tariffâ€‘impacted goods and services keeping pressure on prices. This would take September cutâ€™s off te table. However there is a chance for a milder upside core inflation (thats what the Fed actually looks at), +0.23%â€¯ m/m, helped by tariffs (+8â€¯bps), but still below consensus, and that would leave some room for September cuts.I tell you, what is Trumpâ€™s problem hereâ€¦There is a looming debtâ€service crisis under high interest rates. As Treasury yields rise, they increase discount rates, draw cash away from equities, and elevate risk premia, that compress valuations and trigger corrections. Thereâ€™s a wide gulf between Fedâ€‘fund futures (implying rate cuts) and Fed projections (no cuts until 2026), meaning a Fed surprise could send yieldsâ€”and equity volatilityâ€”much higher. What Trump wants is to get those 3-mo. T-bill yields down by showing artificially low inflation, so that MMF managers pull cash out of bills (yields fall) and redeploy into equities or credit. I posted about the scheme. If Fed cut rates, it can keep the â€œfake growthâ€ alive until the reality of credit dynamics hit laterâ€¦ SubscribeWhat you need to watch is which sideâ€™s will prevails: Team Treasury/White House or the Fedâ€™s technocrats. If the data is dovish enough to reprice Fed cuts or not. Data is always faked, we know that. But that will tell us how the market will evolve in the coming days, weeks and months, and who is in control and so what is the trade for the near-termâ€¦Bearmarket now or a crisis later.

Market analysisCPI day + Intraday post (11/June)Jun 11, 2025âˆ™ Paid181ShareThis data is the last CPI before FOMC, and this is a pivotal data. Mayâ€™s NFP beat (+139 K vs. 130 K est., unemployment steady at 4.2%) signaled a stillâ€resilient labor market, though underlying revisions and participation dips imply mild cooling rather than a hard landing. The April CPI reading of 2.3% y/y appears to have been the trough, and economists now forecast Mayâ€™s headline CPI at 2.5% y/y with a 0.2% m/m increase; core CPI (ex-food and energy) is seen at 2.9% y/y and up 0.3% m/m. Also short-term inflation swaps have surged to about 3.07% over the next 12 months, reflecting the marketâ€™s view that current tariff-driven pressures will lift consumer prices further (~3%) and that Fed rate cuts wonâ€™t come until at least September.My suspicion came true with the SPX/LTY beta, it went neutral-to-positive ahead of CPI: Prices paid indexes (PMI surveys) typically lead CPI by 6 monthsâ€”rising since January, this suggests a June CPI uptick and stronger summer prints. Seems like +0.2% m/m, 2.5% y/y. But the thing is, market has no fear of inflation now. It is priced in. Note, that the paradox of this situation is, that if CPI comes in line with expectations, traders will start to sell vol that is net suppressive for equities in the current environment.

Market analysisCPI forecast, Reversion + Intraday post (10/June)Jun 10, 2025âˆ™ Paid1811ShareFirst lets look at the SPX/LTY beta:Market shows less and less fear of inflation now, but beta is still negative, meaning, a soft CPI print (or any print within the expectations) typically drives yields lower (as it stokes Fedâ€easing bets) and lifts equities.Analysts broadly expect May CPI to show mild headline inflation (+0.16% m/m; +2.4% y/y) and core inflation (+0.27% m/m; +2.9% y/y). Persistent readings above 0.3% m/m could force the Fed to delay cuts further, while soft print buys time for Fed cuts and a quieter Q3. Any upside surprise would trigger stairstep selloff into midsummer tariff shock. If CPI stays sticky while growth slows, the Fed faces persistent stagflation and bearish Q3. SubscribeThe reversion model shows 79.45% probability for a reversion. Momentum wise, as long as SPX holds above 5931.39, ES=F above 5949.05, and VIX below 18.58s, the momentum is not net bearish.I start to scale in based on the probability value, and ready to size up if these levels are proved.

Topic is market principles, Sorosâ€™s reflexivity. Very important topic!Weekly post: FOMC Week, long zomma/short vomma | Weekly post (26-30/Jan)AlmaÂ·Jan 25Read full storyI dropped a very important broader macro and micro market report containing institutionals, geo, yen etc-etc.: Earning season, Micro and Macro flows, Carry trade & Geopolitic landscape | Quant Insights - January 2026AlmaÂ·Jan 23Read full storyIâ€™d like to draw your attention to my latest post on Twitter here.Very important.To be honest with you, I barely traded US markets these days since OpEx, as my currency is Euro. Cross-assets literally kill the profits, be very careful with your currency! Hopefully you monitor price actions in your own, not just in USD terms.Most of the â€œgrowthâ€ here is only on paper by dollar deprecation. You work more but you earn less. Market is up, but value is down. Times are changingâ€¦(ES.H futs in dollar with purple, and in euro with yellow since January OpEx)I also donâ€™t trust this metal rally. I take some gold into cash soon. Even tho there are CB, ETF etc. inflows, this what you see is a speculative spike, that will be realized and put back into assets later (potentially second half of the year). Please, take a brake and listen to Citadel CEO now: FOMC DayMost of the flows that are significant are happening during globex, not RTH. Thatâ€™s where the structure is formed. For now, ES futs has a significant vacuum up to 7060/70 that is expected to be filled. 6970/80 zone is pivotal, and Iâ€™d be a dip buyer until this zone until 2PM. The upside vacuum has an effect. The lower spot goes, the weaker the effect, but it is there until 70s. 6990/7000 is the zone where te effect accelerates. Be careful with FOMC. I see a â€œsell the newsâ€ potential.

# ECB day, OpEx, Post-OpEx flows, Short Vol + Intraday post (17/April)

Market analysisECB day, OpEx, Post-OpEx flows, Short Vol + Intraday post (17/April) Stagflation in the EU, Taylor ruleApr 17, 2025âˆ™ Paid231ShareWeekly post is here, Geopost is here. Very important: ECB set to cut interest rates as insurance against trade tariffs Now if we know the assumed â€œneutralâ€ real interest rate, current inflation rate, the central bankâ€™s inflation target and the real GDP nad its potential, we can assume a benchmark of how a central bank (like ECB) should set its shortâ€‘term nominal interest rate based on two â€œgapsâ€: the inflation gap (current inflation rate minus central bankâ€™s inflation target) and output gap (real GDP minus its potential): it=râˆ—+Ï€t+Î±(Ï€tâˆ’Ï€âˆ—)+Î²(ytâˆ’yâˆ—)where:Â it=Â the target nominal policy rateÂ râˆ—=Â assumed â€œneutralâ€ real interest rateÏ€t=current inflation rateÏ€âˆ—=central bankâ€™s inflation target(ytâˆ’yâˆ—)=% output gap, andÎ±Â andÂ Î²=the weights policymakersÂ choose (often around 0.5)If inflation is above target, central bank should raise rates more. If output is above potential, central bank should raise rates a bit more. If either is below, cut rates. Now, the current ECB deposit facility rate is 2.50%, the main refinancing operations is 2.65%, and the marginal lending facility is 2.90%; while this formula, called the Taylor estimator, says it should be higher by ~52.83% (around ~4.1)Now, as showed above, markets have sharply increased expectations for ECB easing, largely because 1) Trumpâ€™s erratic tariff hikes threaten euroâ€‘area growth and inflation, and 2) a rising euro exerts additional disinflationary pressure by making imports cheaper. As a result, Euribor futures and OIS curves now fully price in a 25 bp cut at the next ECB meeting, with roughly 150 bp of total easing by endâ€‘2025.Nowâ€¦ Trumpâ€™s tariff escalations combined with a strong euro are creating a classic stagflation mix (rising prices and slowing growth), yet markets are betting on ECB rate cuts. They simply donâ€™t dare to hike as much as they should. Similar trap that the US faced back in 2021/22Lose-lose for Madame Lagardeâ€¦ ECB is checkmated by Trumpâ€¦(Btw, this is totally Europeâ€™s fault. They should have raise rates since 2015, but all they have cared is the GDP growth, nothing elseâ€¦)PM OPEXLets look at todayâ€™s positioning, PM expo:This is a net positive speed profile with an overall avg slope of 2.95%But locally below 5300-5314.48 the speed profile is negative with a slope of -11.99% towards 5184.89Coding main pivot at 5305.18, this is the centroid of the whole profile. Coding main downside pivot at 5245.81; this is the line beyond the volatility should start to compress, and downside puts start to act like a magnet. To the upside it is 5355.83, where upside longer gamma can start to stabilize the price action. However, if vol decline too sharply, these lines repell the prices. Now, think strategically a little bit. What is volatility? - The SD of the log returns of a given period, right? So if vol is compressed, this indirectly indicates that liquidity is higher.

Educational postsEfficient market, momentum, mean reversion...No math. High priority knowledge!Jan 31, 2025âˆ™ Paid835ShareIn the following post, Iâ€™m going to introduce the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the empirical deviations from it. I will explain what momentum is, introduce the concept of mean reversionâ€”all to help you understand a century of observations on how the market behaves.HISTORY, BACKGROUNDThe relationship between supply and demand and its impact on prices is one of the most fundamental questions in trade, business, and economics.Modern money and capital markets exist to direct capital to parts of the economy where it is needed for production. Households, as the largest savers, invest their unused income through capital markets into companies and governments that lack funds. Like buyers in commodity markets, these investors carefully select their investments and expect comprehensive information on each opportunity. Naturally, they want the highest return for the risk assumed, whereas capital users seek the lowest-cost funding.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisEurozone yields-up, reshaping global trade (PoS-2) - Intraday post (03/Sept)Sep 03, 2025âˆ™ Paid111ShareMonthly and weekly post is here: SEPTEMBER - Monthly & Weekly post (02-05/Sept)AlmaÂ·September 1, 2025Read full storyDespite long-dated yields spike in Europe, volatility remained in check, manifested through spot: But voilÃ¡, look and see: This is how accurately my formulas workâ€¦ and this is the importance of these zones. Monthly volatility closed at 9.41% from 9.46%, 3-monthly went up by 0.1 bps, and vol of vol by 2.2 bps, despite a sudden 112 pts candle. Spot is staying under control, volatility remains supplied, but set to start to grind up, widening the area of ranging for spot. Europe yield rise I noted this yield spike yesterday premarket, but let me tell you why it is importantâ€¦As long yields grind higher on fiscal/term-premium worries, rich multiples face a headwind. Big Tech/AI names are â€œlong-durationâ€ (more of their value is far in the future). When long-end (especially the real one) yields rise, the present value of those cash flows falls, so P/Es contract and the Nasdaq underperforms. So the opportunity cost of holding expensive growth stocks increases. This is what we saw yesterday. Now, because stock-bond correlation is positive, investorsâ€™ portfolios get hit from two sides and some systematic players de-risk (like me as-well). Markets are re-pricing a higher long-end term premium tied to deficits/debt supply and tariff/inflation frictions. It has begun. Even if Fed cut rates, yields will remain sticky. This recognization will cause some volatility aheadâ€¦ SubscribeFor investors, economistsNow, I must talk to the investors here about oil, tech, global economy reshift in regards of Putin/Xi meetingâ€¦ If itâ€™s not your business, scroll down.Whatâ€™s going onâ€¦ The meeting was scheduled to the SCO/WWII-anniversary week in China, using it to flaunt a non-Western bloc and to sign/announce a raft of cooperation items with Russia. Indiaâ€™s Modi was there for the SCO and met both Xi and Putin. Moscow and Beijing just â€œblessedâ€ PoS-2â€”50 bcm/yr from West Siberia to China via Mongolia. Itâ€™s not a full commercial close yet (pricing/financing still opaque), but Russia permanently re-routes gas once bound for Europe; China locks in overland supply leverage. Markets noticed (Gazprom sold off on terms risk). Even as China sits closer to Russia, Washington just opened a narrow channel: Nvidia/AMD get export licenses for downgraded AI chips to China under a novel 15%-of-revenue skim to the U.S. government. Thatâ€™s a political/transactional carve-out, not a full thawâ€”Beijing still canâ€™t get top chips. Trump publicly squeezed India (tariff threats tied to Russian oil), but still India remains a top buyer of Russian crude and is visibly cordial with Putin/Xi this week. That puts New Delhi in position as a brokerâ€”and as a beneficiary of discounted energyâ€”while it resists picking a side.Washington also kept pressing Abu Dhabi to curtail sanction-evasion routing, but Dubai remains a key financial/logistics node for Russia-adjacent trade. This friend-shore option is still part of the toolkit the Beijing crowd can use even as they trumpet new formal deals. After talks with Xi and Modi, Putin said â€œNATO enlargement has to be addressedâ€ for Ukraine peace and referenced â€œTrump summit understandingsâ€, in order to test a ceasefire/settlement framework while the economic architecture is being built.Longer-term, this pressures global LNG utilisation/margins into the 2030s and dilutes Europeâ€™s leverage over Russian gas. Reuters even notes PoS-2 helps Beijing hedge future reliance on US LNG.Also, near-term Brent is driven more by OPEC+ policy and war-related outages than by the Beijing optics, but the summit reinforces the durability of the India/China demand sink for Russian crude.The U.S.â€“China chip carve-out survives (with political heat), letting China keep building AI capacity; that indirectly cushions Russiaâ€™s tech access. Xi also advances yuan-centric settlement across the SCO periphery. Dollar will be kept burning.

Market analysisExtended weekly breakdown (SPX, Gold, Bitcoin) + Intraday post (24/Nov)Nov 24, 2025âˆ™ Paid13ShareFree, overview, breakdown of the current momentum: [free] SPX, Gold, BTC - A quick overview of the recent momentum and sentimentAlmaÂ·November 18, 2025Read full storyWeekly post: Summary - Pre-weekly post (23/Nov)AlmaÂ·November 23, 2025Read full storyI experience some software issues not being able to process positioning datas. Iâ€™m on itâ€¦Until I wonâ€™t post the usual speed profile breakdowns, but will go more technical and OD chart-based. For SPX,as you know, I expected a pullback, a deeper correction (6-10%) in order to wash out the risk properly to build a more sustainable structure for the coming months. Now, it seems like happening finally on the spot level too not just time correction. The best would be if SPX would be let to give it to 6390/6450 area that I marked in my Window of Risk post to give a higher confidence rally until late Q1/early Q2 (March-April window).My primal upside target after this pullback (if the SPX stabilizes at my bottom target, and not breaks below the February highs) is 7146.88; but also see 7270/80 to play out. The more â€œscaryâ€ the recent pullback is, the higher the market can go after. On the weekly basis, my pov is simple:As I covered, I think Friday rebound was kinda too early while it wasnâ€™t enough to take out the upside target areas to mitigate the bearish pressure on the spot. My bias is that the bottoming process will start to occur during Monday and Tuesday, including sentiment. While in these next two days, the market can give us the original bottom target.However, I must note that if the sentiment does not coming up, the market remains headline sensitive, and if the consolidation fails in this ranges and volatility makes higher lows here, we could see the 10% pullback down to the 200-VWMA and ~6220 with a sharp high volatility decline (like in the case of an ending diag).This is way less likely in my pov, but I must note it, because it is a probability and policy now is unpredictable. The consolidation pattern should show lowering volatility locally while taking out the Thursday highs first. If structure is built beside low RV, the odds are increased to go and take out the marked upside area where the bearish pressure eases and market can start to march higher. I think it is also a lower probability to happen this week, I see it to happen once the Fed â€œbails out the sentimentâ€ over the next week. I find it pretty likely monitoring the timing of the announcements and reactions. The highest probability for the week is to build structure at the bottom target at max, and starting to march higher into the next week. The key takeaway here is that the pullback provide us a nice BTD opportunity.The reason I donâ€™t want to short this anymore is because 1) got a decent profit already, 2) reversion probability is above 50% (even 68%+) quantitatively. Iâ€™m not bearish near to the local bottoms, and the 10% scenario is too uncertain to make any proper bets. Iâ€™m not into taking unnecessary risk. Watch if VIX can take out the lower bound of the weekly range! That will be the tell. SubscribeFor GOLD the pov is similar. Bearish pressure remains until the market cannot take out 4145/4245, that I see less likely now. But overall would confirm the pattern that it wants to retest 3920 first, and potentially the 200-VWMA. Bitcoin is at a local pivot, from where a retest of 102k and my initial 112-115k area is the most likely scenario. It is simply because volatility cannot be let extend further now, and volatility is meassured through spot and time.However a failed rally into 112-115k area would confirm the bear-trend. This is logical as the broad market is risk-off, breadth is horrible. As you know, my pov is that BTC will go down to 50k where I will start to buy again and increase its weight in my portfolio as fundamentals have changed. Honestly, I donâ€™t know if it will give one more hit to the highs over the next few weeks/months. 112-115k area retest will show us, and I donâ€™t even care. Statistically, one more leg up is likely, but I donâ€™t want to time the absolute bottoming of it. When it gives my downside targets, I will start to re-accumulate.

Market analysisFed, Distribution, Revision of weekly post + Intraday post (25/June)Free short education on distributionJun 25, 2025âˆ™ Paid1312ShareFedPowell reaffirmed a â€œwait-and-seeâ€ approach as expected, unwilling to look through tariff-driven price increases until clearer data on pass-through and magnitude arrive. He signaled rate-cut flexibility later this yearâ€”â€œsooner rather than laterâ€ if inflation remains containedâ€”but declined to target a specific meeting, leaning toward a September cut over July. Market prices only 15.9% probability to hold rates. A significant majority of FOMC participants penciled in cuts later this year under scenarios of subdued inflation or labor-market weakness. Also, the LEI dipped 0.1% in May 2025 to 99.0, marking its sixth consecutive monthly drop and triggering the Conference Boardâ€™s formal recession signal. Although the Board does not forecast a recession, it expects a significant growth slowdown, projecting ~1.6% real GDP growth for 2025. Fed policy moves hinge on June and July inflation prints. They arenâ€™t yet ready to â€˜look throughâ€™ tariff increases without clearer data on their size and pass-through to consumer prices.The divergence is shady. Downside remains managed for now, but Augustus window will be a surprise and pivot. SubscribeDistributionI try to explain this through tools you can also use without purchasing thousands of datas to model vol surfacesâ€¦ So, a little bit of theory here first. At the beginning there was the constant volatility and normal distribution mathematically measured by vega. But vega has got a convexity as tail OTM contracts (letâ€™s say ~5-10 deltas now) get higher risk premium, because higher change in IV elevates the risk for the seller that the contract will end up ITM, elevating the kurtosis (â€œtailednessâ€ or the propensity for extreme values) of the distribution, so as a result this draws the known vol smile. This vega convexity is called vomma or volga (vol gamma). But the distribution is not symmetrical at all, itâ€™s median, mode and mean are constantly moving. Equity markets typically have occasional large negative returns, occuring more often than a Gaussian model predicts, I wrote an educational post about it. Thus, left tail is fatter, and skewness is negative. As a result, investors and traders spend more on buying downside protection than betting on upside, and this skewness appears in the vol surface too, creating the smirk (â€œleft-skewed smileâ€ basically). What we are seeing is basically that, as we slide left or right on the x-axis (spot), we get higher/lower vol risk premium. This change of vol vs spot, and thus the skewness is described by vanna. This convexity is highest typically at the 15-35 delta ranges (I like 22 deltas to measure vanna). Here you can see the past one month, simplified: We can see leptokurtic behavior (kurtosis of 0.8605, but moderate-excess as 1 > kurtosis > 0), and also fatter right tail with skewness of 0.644542, while downside moves are clipped by mean reversion. The kurtosis was higher after Friday close and skewness was lower than today. This is the realization of the short vanna and vol of vol supply dynamics I was writing about. Scrutinizing the trend in the numbers as I code the â€œrolling realized distributionâ€, Monday was a pivotal day, squeezed right to the marked weekly level that I provided as the border of the downside gamma â€œgravitational fieldâ€, and interestingly it showed that Tuesday was a squeeze, but moderated as right tail was actually sold a bit, that flattened the short vanna regime. We can also see this tendency in the past month looking simply at the SPX/VIX realized beta making higher lows and catched up a bit after yesterday session: And if you look at the realized vol didnâ€™t broke its support yet, vol of vol remains suppressed, while RV realized up by an insignificant 0.11 step from 12.88% to 12.99% Now, I scrutinized the rolling distribution of VIX tooâ€¦The skewness monoton fell since Friday, while kurtosis kept going up.  Shorter-dated options have more vomma, while medium-term it is vanna effect that dominates. This reinforces the SPX tail put selling bcs it means that VIX traders sold the right-tail and also explains why both SPX/VIX beta and SPX RV catched up a bit, on this yesterday squeeze. But also donâ€™t forget, that in the near-term, traders buy VIX vomma, telling me, they expect a sharper move in the VIX IV in the near-term, potentially down, because they buy downside VIX vega and sell upside. This would create a vaccum effect at the SPX upside tails, while compressing the SPX short vanna range (pushing the flip zone down). I think this is what we are seeing materializing now. And if Iâ€™m correct, we should see VIX IV selling below 17s - 16.5s, and that would shift the SPX regime and stabilize the price upward around 6120 even 6170 (some output even told me 6240â€¦ not that irreal given the coming July 4th). But this squeeze should happen here around 6100 to get the unclench. This would be reinforced by the accumulated negative zomma too. If not, I will short only, when my model shows, will signal in real-time. Otherwise it will just chop.And that would be the squeeze Iâ€™d be short. Reversion model doesnâ€™t give red dot yet. We are in a negative-to-neutral, flat-short vanna regime, market is illiquid at these levels. Algos are trading, while VIX is foreshadowing a regime shift up.But vol selling now still caps upside, and elevates the odds of retesting the weekly upside bound at 6024/34 zone.Reassuming weekly postWhatâ€™s behind the squeeze? 1) Managed war risk premium, as said, that got unwound as Putin came to mediate between US and Iran as it was foretold in March as a part of the slowly-forming US/RUS alliance (Putin-Xi negotiation is next soon to solve US trade war), and 2) artificially created optimistic outlook for growth, even shifting sentiment towards â€œbad news are good newsâ€, even tho metrics show that the underlying concern is still the recession, and August. They will try to solve it. August-Sept window will be the pivot for bear-market. I marked 6024 and 6034 as the lvls for the week, below the effects I described was in effect, along with steady geo risk. These levels were broken during the overnight, when ceasefire agreements were managed in the Middle-East, through the Russians. The thing I overestimated when I was writing the weekly post, is the unwound and profit taking effect. It literally flattened the skew positions as I showed above, and pushed the market into a flat-to-neutral vol regime. Market should break below 6048.96 daily in order to get back into the previous regime. No short yet.We have GDP and PCE datas tomorrow and on Friday. No trades in an illiquid algo-messâ€¦ We made enough through the last weeksâ€¦ Market is literally in a regime shifting-repricing mode.

Market analysisFed pivot is looming? Tariff risk, Sentiment + Intraday post (26/June)Jun 26, 2025âˆ™ Paid92ShareYesterday I revised my weekly post after the market broke out of the weekly range and unwound a lot of geo risk positions from Monday to Tuesday. It is half-free, and educational on distributions. Take your time on itâ€¦ Fed, Distribution, Revision of weekly post + Intraday post (25/June)AlmaÂ·June 25, 2025Read full storyLet me show you somethingâ€¦FFF6 is the June 2025 Fed-funds futures contract. Its implied rate has fallen to 0.6350%The 5-yr vs 30-yr Treasury spread keeps widening, a bear-steepening sign as the belly price moves on front-end rate-cut bets even while long-end yields stay elevated on fiscal concerns. This tells us demand held, but only at current yieldsâ€”so any â€œdovish shockâ€ (e.g. weak NFP â†’ Fed cut) would likely drive 5-year yields sharply lower.Also note, that the Nasdaq/Russell ratio (not shown here) sitting at multi-year highs underscores that mega-caps are front-running any dovish pivot, even as broader cyclicals lag. Fed driven deltas. In dovish regimes, frontrunning pivots, mega-cap tech often outperforms, lifting this ratio, whereas in reflationary or risk-on phases, small caps can lead. Market prices a Fed pivot on a bad NFP print. As I mentioned in the weekly post and earlier, sentiment is artificially shifted towards â€œbad news are good newsâ€. But with hgiher lows, as recession fears are looming into August-Sept window. With no August FOMC meeting, the Fed can use July data to gauge tariff-driven inflation before acting.I expect a potential stagflationary slowdown into August, cutting their 2025 GDP at ~1.3% and recession fears coming back, driven mostly by tariff-induced growth drag and persistent inflation. Bessentâ€™s buybacks help temporaly mitigate a yield shock, supporting equities if tariffs spark a rise in long-end yields. If August inflation prints show only a temporary tariff bump, markets may still price in Fed cuts by Q4, bolstering risk assets. My thoughts on theseâ€¦To me this market seems like aims to be supported into July 4, and tries to swallow any impact of the July 8-9 reciprocal-tariff deadlineâ€”when the 90-day pause on Trumpâ€™s â€œLiberation Dayâ€ duties expires.The NQ/RTY ratio spikes not just on fundamentals but also because rapid, vol-sensitive flows concentrate in mega-caps (lower gamma cost); dealer hedges and ETF rebalances then narrow breadth by reinforcing the winners. Every dip in tech (or bounce in vol) triggers a wave of vol-control and gamma-hedge buyingâ€”lifting the ratio further, even if small-caps or cyclicals lack fundamental momentum.But once July 8â€™s tariff cliff and August catalysts arrive, volatility control funds will sell into rising vol, CTAs will squeeze out of steepeners, and buybacks canâ€™t absorb a broad sell-offâ€”so both yields and equities may snap back sharply. However these sentiment-driven interventions mitigate the raw auction, curve and Fed-futures signals in the near term. So, no vol squeeze eventâ€¦ Vol of vol supply, you knowâ€¦I will signal short, when I see that.

Market analysisFed, QE, Bulltrap? + Intraday post (30/April) Apr 30, 2025âˆ™ Paid1913ShareHere is the big landscape and weekly post againâ€¦And chinese plane landed in Beirut. This post is playing outâ€¦Derivatives markets now price in a 44â€“50% chance of a rate cut at the next June FOMC. Traders expect rapidâ€fire cuts if JOLTS and CPI disappoints. Job openings fell by 288,000 in March 2025â€”the steepest drop since 2021â€”dropping to 7.192 million. This single datum sent markets scrambling to price in softer NFP and higher recession odds. U.S. import volumes from China plunged 36â€“43%, and booking cancellations hit more than 50% on key lanes. â€˜Empty shelvesâ€™If inventories run out â†’ sales disappointments â†’ layoffs begin: continuing claims jumped 41,000 to 1.885 million.So we can expect a broad economic pullback. Our beloved Bessent publicly lean into the rhetoric of â€œstrategic uncertainty,â€ signaling to markets that a downturn (and thus rate cuts) is desirable, plus IMF, JPM, Fed governors, and Trump himself create a chorus of easing demands. This sequence is magnified by the bullwhip effect.Now, listenâ€¦The May 2 de minimis tariff change and April 9 steep tariffs both landed just before key data releases, amplifying their impactPowell has stressed that rate cuts are not on a preset path and depend on clear evidence of slack.So the string of weakening data is not purely coincidental but rather part of a coordinated effort (by policymakers, fiscal authorities) to generate enough economic stress to justify Federal Reserve rate cuts. A sharp JOLTS collapse signals cooling NFP, which feeds into a freightâ€volumes slump, leading to empty shelves within weeks, and ultimately rising joblessness. Each step reflects how weakening labor demand ripples through goods movement and inventory, then back into hiring, completing a negative feedback loop.Be carefulâ€¦If they really pull off that rate cut in June, weâ€™ll likely see a modest bull runâ€”much like last Octoberâ€™sâ€”provided, as Iâ€™ve said, that GDP and NFP data align. That said, inflationary pressures will reemerge by mid-summer. And while QE could stave off a deflationary spiral in the short term, it isnâ€™t sustainableâ€”stagflation today runs deeper than before. Best to sit back and let the events unfold.

Market analysisFOMC Day, Bessent put (hidden QE) + Intraday post (18/June)Jun 18, 2025âˆ™ Paid93ShareWeekly postI dropped this tweet yesterdayâ€¦Yesterday I explained that the consensus among analysts is that he will maintain a cautious, data-dependent stance with no explicit tilt toward rate cuts. Fed funds futures imply near-zero odds of a June cut, pushing the first cut out to September at the earliest. Inflation expectations remain elevated: the University of Michiganâ€™s June survey shows 1-year ahead at 5.1% (down from 6.6%) and long-run at 4.1%, both still well above the Fedâ€™s 2% target. Only a surprise oil-shock (Hormuz) or midsummer tariff surge could force a dovish pivot. Meanwhile tthe Fed recent bondâ€buying activity is about reinvesting maturing securities and slowing QT. When the Fed reduced its monthly runoff cap from $60 billion to $25 billion of Treasuries on June 1, it basically slowed down QT. Bessent shifted toward shortâ€dated bills aimed at capping 10-year yields by manipulating supply, temporarily helping to anchor term premia. The underlying driver is that investors shy away from funding a heavily indebted economy.

Market analysisFOMC day, Intraday post (07/May)May 07, 2025âˆ™ Paid1313ShareBefore you continue reading:1. Weekly post2. Monday post about Fed pt. 13. Tuesday post about Fed pt. 2 + Big sum and geo post Most major ports have seen 20â€“30 percent declines in 20-foot container loadings from China (TEUs booked) between Febâ€“Mar versus Marâ€“Mayâ€”steep, but nowhere near a 50â€“60 percent collapse. Some ports even bucked the trend (e.g. Miami +18 percent, Jacksonville +33 percent), suggesting pockets of resilience or rerouting. Powell & colleagues have repeatedly promised â€œampleâ€ liquidity and a willingness to step in if markets seize upâ€”softening any sell-off. The Fedâ€™s repo operations, bank liquidity lines, and extensions of FIMA swap facilities have quietly flooded funding markets with cash, keeping credit spreads tight and preventing a shipping-finance crunch. Even as real volumes dip, shipping companies and traders still get credit, which cushions the volume drop and keeps P-Lâ€™s from blowing up. This is not just the Fed in isolation. Other central banks (ECB, BoE, SNB) have been conducting back-to-back repo operations and verbal easing guidance in lockstepâ€”so trade finance stays liquid worldwide. Governments are back-stopping cargo liens, export-credit agencies are guaranteeing bills of lading, all to avoid a cascade of defaults that would amplify the volume shock.Cutting rates now would risk reigniting cost-push inflation (tariff shock still working through the system). Instead, the Fed can keep injecting liquidity to â€œpegâ€ financial conditions in a wide range, letting real-economy volumes gently drift down rather than crashâ€”and buying time until the worst tariff effects hit in mid-summer/Q3.Once those Mayâ€“June shipments (front-run pre-tariff orders) clear, youâ€™ll see real supply-chain shortages, steeper volume declines at ports, and a sharper hit to GDP and corporate earnings. Thatâ€™s when the Fed will face real â€œfight or cutâ€ pressureâ€”by then, only a rate cut (or more aggressive measures) can avert a financial-and-trade spiral.Now, think about the last days eventsâ€¦Trump told reporters on May 6 that a â€œvery bigâ€ and â€œearth-shatteringâ€ announcement was coming before his Middle East trip. Markets jumped on the hope of a positive catalystâ€”pushing ES higherâ€”but quickly retraced as no concrete details emerged. On May 7, India conducted airstrikes on militant infrastructure in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan claimed to have shot down five Indian jets amid civilian casualties. Despite this dangerous flare-up, Indiaâ€™s rupee and equities barely budgedâ€”only to serve as an excuse to sell ES into the close, driving futures to session lows. Also on May 6â€“7, Bessent confirmed urgent U.S.â€“China trade negotiations in Switzerland over the weekend. That news immediately reversed the late-session sell-offâ€”pushing ES back upâ€”despite scant detail on the talksâ€™ scope or timeline.This is how they are messing with sentiment reading algos. Confusion over which â€œsurpriseâ€ matters most keeps algorithmic strategies stuck in volatility neutral mode, reducing the risk of a sharp Fed-induced gap. Because by mixing bullish (Trump tease, trade talks) and bearish (geopolitical risk) headlines, â€œtheyâ€ can pin ES within a tight range, discouraging directional bets just before the Fed. The sell right after ER reports were telling. Some funds have started to short. But I would still wait for the marked events to unfold.

Note, that the beta is not above zero, still negative... but later on thatâ€¦As said yesterday, VIX expo hasnâ€™t a too big impact, and we can expect less impact, even if some ES=F selling can be expected. But beta climbed higher, so the impact of beta hedge is mitigated. After I simulated the implied distribution and calculated the fair value of an 0DTE ATM SPX contract (taking into account the implied skewness and kurtosis), this is what I foundâ€¦ The ATM put IV is priced higher by 18.84% than what the fair value would imply, while call IV is priced by 3.1% higher as wellâ€¦Now, both is above its fair value, but the implied skewness is positive and intraday speed profile is negative! And this is a huge discrepancy. This means that dealers are buyers of the downside bets and sellers of the upside bets. With these prices - if we assume that the house always fakes the odds to get a favorable expected value - this means that Wall Street prices a left-tailish day, opposite to what the positioning says. They basically say that the market will not give it to the gamblers who are buyers of the upside bets. And this aligns with that slightly negative-to-netural SPX/yields beta, making algos to read the cut as â€œnot too bad newsâ€. SubscribeThe reversion model says that the probability for a reversion is at 93.50%, very rare value!If this is right, market is topped here, and after the OpEx is gone, market will slowly rebalance itself.

Futures price an October cut as very likely and high odds of another in December.Inside the September meeting, Gov. Stephen Miran argued for a 50 bp cut while the Committee delivered 25 bpâ€”so the minutes should reveal how many leaned toward a larger move or faster path. This matters for whether October/December look â€œpre-setâ€ or still data-contingent. With the shutdown delaying key data (payrolls, CPI timing risk), we should expect text about acting pre-emptively vs waiting for confirmation.

Market analysisFOMC preview, Trading advises + Intraday post (17/June)FOMC, Hormuz, Retail Sales, Intraday postJun 17, 2025âˆ™ Paid15ShareYesterday, my vanna model said 6050 as max if vol doesnâ€™t calms down, giving us a 60 pts profit during the overnight. The intraday spot/vol beta yesterday was 0.095062 in avg, 0.043498 as median, and closed at 1.007296, a 478.034252% increase during the day. Meanwhile vvol (white line) was realized to the downside, just right as the Sunday post predicted: Hormuz is well-threatened, and we need to monitor closely if the skew goes longer or not, bcs that can reverse the vol profile. Until nothing unexpected happens, I think it is enough to reassume on the next Sunday, but letâ€™s keep our eyes on that risk. You find the descriptions in my Sunday post. Before I jump into the short FOMC preview, I want to re-share my yesterday write-up of intraday trading. It is free for all subs: Stochastic Volatility - Options market insightsImportant trading advice + Intraday post (16/June)SPX is trading at 6013 while Iâ€™m writing these linesâ€¦Read more8 months ago Â· 17 likes Â· 2 comments Â· Alma Please, take your time to re-read it. SubscribeFOMC PreviewFederal Reserve plans to hold its policy rate steadyâ€”even though recent inflation readings have been benignâ€”because policymakers remain highly attuned to inflation expectations and tariff- and geoâ€related uncertainties that could reignite price pressures.Midsummer tariffs create enough uncertainty that the Fedâ€™s dot plot may shift hawkishly, delaying cuts into late 2025 or even into 2026.The Fedâ€™s caution reflects a desire to anchor expectations rather than risk repeating past mistakes of premature easing, noting that businesses and workers may act on even small upticks in expected inflation by raising prices and wage demands. University of Michiganâ€™s show that consumer inflation expectations briefly rose after tariff announcementsâ€”even if they later moderatedâ€”highlighting the Fedâ€™s concern that continued tariff uncertainty can become self-fulfilling. Also, as said on Sunday, the Strait of Hormuz remains a potent inflation/stagflation risk, as even the threat of closure can add a $10â€“$15/bbl risk premium to oil pricesâ€”enough to lift headline inflation by 0.1â€“0.3 percent if sustained. (Note that a full blockade could send Brent to $120â€“$130). At the same time, the â€œmidsummerâ€ tariffs set to kick in around July 9 2025 (notably 50% on EU goods and expanded metals levies) are projected to pass through into core goods PCE, contributing 0.1â€“0.3 percent to inflation by year-end. Market is still more concerned about growth than inflation, but mostly neutral. Literally less narrative now, in these uncertain times. The trend still points up, telling me, growth is the main narrative. Trump is about to pump the economic performace to show result for his business partners in the Middle East. I still expect vol to be capped during this month and next month until tariffs hit in August.

We had a nice 98.1 point sell-off day on Wednesday. However I marked the weekly centroid as very importnat because speed, vanna and even zomma worked against downside acceleration if that level is held. Premarket intraday update showed us that it will be held well, kurtosis was heavily sold. Both for Oct 6 and Oct 13 weeks I predicted rangin for the first half of the week within a certain level then volatility spike into Thursday-Friday window. First time we got a 265.85 pts decline after ranging, second time we got a 139.3 pts sell-off. For the Oct 13 week, it was clear that the market sold both the left-tail and tailedness, and that it wonâ€™t break the structure. Market has chosen to hide risk through time-correction. The economic datas versus the reality and accumulated policy and geo risks that the market also feels, bids on it too but not enough, also proved that sentiment remains rigged. However, any policy escalation is dangerous. Not overly, you will see, that volatility (RV and IV to) remains under control, and they have every tools to do it, but stillâ€¦ Momentum-wise, the 6858.68 is the pivotal zone for this week, that can form a double top. Macro still supports quality risk but with geopolitical hedges. SubscribeFOMCConsensus is very strong for a 25 bps cut. Even tho the shutdown delayed key releases, markets still price a cut and the Fed is focused on the labor side of the mandate. This is key, because it is not healthy on the long-run, but bullish on equities and gold on the short-run. Stopping QT as soon as this meeting is also on the table, due to signs of funding frictions (see SRF usage spike last week) â€” a plumbing backstop, not stimulus. Core PCE expectations into Friday release is about +0.2% m/m after the softer 0.2% core CPI; historically core PCE tends to run a touch below core CPI on a monthly basis. Recent prints show 0.2â€“0.3% m/m as the live range. (August core PCE was +0.2% m/m.)And ~2.8â€“2.9% y/y (August was 2.9%). The September CPI outcome (core +0.2% m/m) nudged expectations toward the lower end of that band.For GDP the expectation is 3.8 - 3.9%, this is still ok for a cut.Donâ€™t forget that the key problem what the admin aims to manage is the debt burden over inflation! QT halt could be signaled at the upcoming meeting to create a hidden stimulus. (Stopping runoff raises bank-reserve growth vs the counterfactual, lowering the risk of collateral squeezes/repo spikes. That cuts left-tail liquidity risk, which supports credit and equities even without QE.)If you see HY/IG spreads tightening while index vol compresses into buyback windows, you know whatâ€™s happeningâ€¦ SubscribeLetâ€™s scrutinize the weekly fixed strike skew, volatility expectations and distribution, dealer positioningâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

What market did is building that structure I was talking about in the Oct27 area, 3 weeks ago, when signaled dip buyingâ€¦The stability of this liquidity is questionable as market is still waiting for the Fedâ€™s green light. Realized volatility declined only by 6.29% over the past week, currently at 15.70%, still above my stable target of 13.60-14.22%, but according to the vol of vol bets, market expects it to be taken out in the following week. The bets of the market for the next weekly volatility and spot movements are quite interesting as Fed easing cycle expectations will be likely diminished as datas came out in-line (as I predicted from the premarket positioning), and market is only 50 pts away from all-time-highs, after a steep and aggressive rally. JOLTs is on Dec9FOMC is on Dec10,PPI is on Dec11The expectation is a hawkish cut, while the sentiment is â€œbad news is good newsâ€, and this signal a very short-living risk into FOMC, I will scrutinize below, but any weak data is welcomed by the markets as it provides more room for long-term dovishness. The key is that market sentiment is shifted towards Trumpâ€™s narrative who wants cut due to the debt burden I explained months ago. This tells you who is at the wheel.However!There are two policy shocks I want you to keep in mind: the Supreme Court tariff ruling and another shutdown, whose probability and impact isnâ€™t being reflected in consensus positioning right now.This is mostly for longer-term speculators. These risks did not disappeared. And this is a hidden left-tail, market does not care about now.

# Game of probabilities

Educational postsGame of probabilitiesModerate math warning!Jan 27, 2025âˆ™ Paid447ShareIn the following post, I will define the concepts of determinism and stochasticism to clarify and refine the approach. I will also explain what 'probability' actually means from a mathematical perspective, as an introduction to the fundamentals of risk management.Determinism means that the final output of a process is causally inevitable. It implies that a process is entirely driven by causality, and the outcome depends solely on the variables involved. There is no randomness, and thus the system will always produce the same output from a given starting condition or initial state.For example, imagine a computer running a well-defined algorithm. It will always produce the same output for the same inputs, calculated deterministically. Our classical physical laws have also been viewed as deterministic because they are based on differential equations and function algorithmically.However, in the real world, no system is truly deterministicâ€”not even a computer. Using deterministic models is a simplification we often employ when analyzing processes at a macro level. This simplification works because it is easier and "good enough" to describe certain systems this way (e.g., the path of a thrown rock).Why is it "good enough"? Simply because complex systems tend to exhibit properties that their individual parts do not possess. When these parts interact with one another, they create a larger unit or system that produces well-observed, repeating patterns, unified behaviors, or properties that can be described deterministically. This phenomenon is known as emergence.Take the example of a thrown rock: beyond the macro level, countless variables and forces (wind, temperature, air pressure, momentum of small particles, molecules, etc.) influence its path. However, on a macro scale, the rock follows a clear trajectory that can be described reasonably well using deterministic models. If you throw it again with the same force, the path will be almost identical.Similarly, society is composed of thousands of individuals, each with their unique inner world. Yet, as a collective, society exhibits regular behavioral patterns.(This additive effect of random processes is a primary subject of chaos theory.)On the other hand, when we discuss random processes, we refer to stochasticism. Stochastic systems are entirely random, meaning there is a 50-50% probability for various outcomes, as discussed in my previous article on volatility.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

As said, the key trigger is the inflation. More details is in the post above.We have GDP, Home sales and druable goods orders MoM release today. The consensus about GDP is little or no revision to the secondâ€‘estimate reading of 3.3% annualised growth. Home Sales is expected to report sales around 3.93/98â€¯million annualised units, down from 4.01â€¯million in July. Affordability remains the main brakeâ€”30â€‘year mortgage rates near 7% keep buyers on the sidelines despite gradual easing. Meanwhile SPX/yields correlation is neutral: But the trend is up, so short-term sentiment is shifting towards â€œbad news are bad news, good news are good newsâ€.The annual comprehensive revisions to GDP will also be released; they could change the historic profile even if the Q2 headline stays at 3.3%PCE tomorrow is way more important. It is expected to come at 0.28â€“0.35% m/m. This is because of shelter, while PCE has heavier weights on goods prices, which fell.Anyway, a print above 0.25% m/m would push threeâ€‘month annualised core PCE above 3.5%, raising doubts about disinflation.

Market analysisGDP & PCE day - Intraday post (23/Dec)Dec 23, 2025âˆ™ Paid10ShareWeekly post: GDP Release - Weekly post (22-26/Dec) [FREE post]AlmaÂ·December 20, 2025Read full storyGDP came up higher than expected, basucally the highest since Q3 of 2023 (under Biden admin lol). Real GDP (Q3 2025, SAAR): +4.3% (Q2 was +3.8%)  However PCE price index came out +2.8% (Q2: +2.1%) and core PCE even higher at +2.9% (Q2: +2.6%). Gross private domestic investment is roughly flat (-0.02pp), with inventories a drag (-0.22pp). Now, a sizable part of the upside GDP comes from imports falling, which mechanically boosts GDP. A cleaner â€œunderlying demandâ€ read is real final sales to private domestic purchasers at +3.0% that is still strong, but meaningfully below 4.3%. Now, lookâ€¦a meaningful portion of the headline strength came from trade/import dynamics (imports falling boosts GDP arithmetically), while the underlying domestic-demand proxy was â€œonlyâ€ 3.0%. That reduces the case for a clean, broad-based earnings acceleration impulseâ€”so the rates headwind can dominate more easily. SubscribeNarrative matters. If the market concludes that the GDP â€œheatâ€ is mostly backward-looking noise and keeps pricing the same Fed path, that can be bullish later. Now, it is a headwind for risk assets.

Market analysisGeo and policy uncertainity is here - Weekly post (10-14/Nov)Nov 09, 2025âˆ™ Paid221ShareUpdated window of risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update AlmaÂ·October 29, 2025Read full storyThe last weekThe SCOTUS hearing on Trumpâ€™s tariff authority (held Wednesday, Nov 5) was the weekâ€™s most consequential event for policy risk. Challening whether President Trump lawfully used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners and sanctions. Event futures prices 4:5 odds that Trump loses the case. A loss for Trump could mean the Treasury must refund billions in tariff revenue, worsening the fiscal deficit (we can expect like $130â€“140 billion in tariff refunds, that is like 0.5% of the US GDP). Of course, there would be procedural delays and perhaps political maneuvering. But this is something that the equitites do not price in. Trump also agreed to halve tariffs (from 20% to 10%) on Chinese imports and Xi promised to postpone its planned export restrictions on rare earth minerals for one year and committed to buy more U.S. agricultural products, in exchange. Also Switzerland might be close to getting US tariffs reduced.However, the fact that these are ad-hoc deals also injects some uncertainty â€“ theyâ€™re not part of a coherent global framework, but rather Trumpâ€™s bilateral bargaining.Shutdownsâ€¦ It not only caused the data issues noted earlier but also threatened to start tangibly dragging on the economy. Defense contractors were facing delays in payments, federal employees missed paychecks, and the FAA (air traffic control) staffing was so strained that the US Transportation Secretary warned of 20% flight cuts and even larger disruptions approaching Thanksgiving if the shutdown continued. NFP has also not been released. Trump decided to hold off on military action in Venezuela (against the russian ally Maduro) for now due to the Court hearing. Launching a war without Congress would raise another set of legal issues (War Powers Act). Trump might have calculated that opening two big legal fronts at once (tariffs in SCOTUS and a Venezuela intervention drawing court challenges) could be risky. SubscribeAll in all Trumpâ€™s hardball tactics (tariffs, shutdown threats) are backfiring, leaving him with less leverage and the market with more uncertainty. Look at the news: polls showed blame on leadership for the shutdown, and the election results (e.g. in Virginia, Ohio) were seen as a warning to Republicans to moderate.This is something that this 20-21x overvalued market does not price in properly. Too optimistic instead. Plus Fed made a hawkish cut, flattening the yield curve, tempering expectations for Dec, and pushing down front-end. The tariff hearing added to upward yield pressure, but market is optimistic on the medium run.Geopolitical fragmentation and tech AI now drive markets as much as, if not more than, the traditional business cycle. I remain pro-risk, specifically overweight US equities, because US companies (especially in tech) benefiting disproportionately from themes like AI.Hedges increased, dark pools showed no bid, uncertainity emerged during the week. If Trump keeps failing bringing certainity to the economy and markets, this gonna be bloody. This is the keyâ€¦For now, Iâ€™m cautiously optimistic on the longer-run (yearly). Benefit from the US strength (aways from EU) and AI boom, but be aware that the world is volatile and it is changing. Favor quality bonds as hedges despite short-term yield pops.

Market analysisGeopolitics, tech, context for 2025Mar 02, 2025âˆ™ Paid7197ShareIn this article, I will outline the key elements of the geopolitical chess game to provide context for current events and market movements. The past year in the markets was all about preparing for Trumpâ€™s victory, as I noted in February. Now we are going to examine what this yearâ€™s story is.The information comes from friends working in intelligence agencies and Middle Eastern insiders. Everything is going to changeâ€¦Culture, religion The soul of every society and nation is its culture. This was true in ancient times, and it remains true in the modern eraâ€”whether that culture is based on religion, philosophy, sociological structures, or even a pseudo-culture.Yet, throughout history, the underlying interests have always remained the same: natural resources, arable land, water, and security. And that is exactly what itâ€™s about today. Loyalty and alliances between nations and their leaders are formed on cultural and religious foundations. The more common ground they share, the stronger the bond. And the more value a nation can bring to the negotiating tableâ€”along with effective leverage (such as military power or economic influence)â€”the stronger its bargaining position becomes. These are fundamental aspects to understand. Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

The Fedâ€™s easing bias and upside risk to breakevens are the bullish pillars.Gold is effectively short beta to real yields, so the biggest left-tail is a real-yield backup / curve steepenerâ€”thatâ€™s what we should hedge.Gold doesnâ€™t produce cash flow and is prone to regime swings. Itâ€™s a hedge/insurance, not a compounding engine. So, treat gold as exposure to inflation/real-rate factors rather than an â€œasset class.â€ Size it by risk budget and factor diversification, not notional. Manage the overlap with duration/ breakeven risk in the rest of the portfolio, so you donâ€™t double up on the same macro bet. SubscribeMeasure your portfolioâ€™s gold to real-rate beta: regress Î”gold vs Î”10y TIPS yield and vs Î”breakeven; update rolling. Adjust rates-up hedges to the beta. TY/US put spreads (short 10y/long-bond futures via puts) sized by DV01 to your estimated goldâ€“rates beta (mind vol risk!). Or bear-steepener options (2s10s/5s30s payer spreads) to cover a potential curve-steepening riskâ€¦ GLD/XAU puts or collars (e.g., 3â€“6M 25Î” put financed with a 10â€“15Î” call sale) to protect against ETF-inflow stall/reversal. Because downside is on the table if ETF inflows stop.Or if youâ€™re not set up to manage rate hedges, consider simpler collars or a multi-asset inflation sleeve (gold + TIPS + commodities) to diversify the bet.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

This was the steepest daily fall since 2020. In the week(s) prior, gold broke $4,000 (Oct 8), then $4,100 (Oct 13) and $4,200 (Oct 15), and 1M GLD IV ~30% with IVâ€“RV ~12.5% was very rich, driven by a mix of rate-cut bets, geopolitics, and ETF/CB demand, a correction was inevitable. These drivers however didnâ€™t disappear. I remain bullish on Gold until 3100/3200 zone holds. Late longs also can be squeezed out. 3700/3800 area are on the table, if 4k is weak now. Good buy-the-dip opportunity for long-term hold. SubscribeChinaNew U.S. tariff actions on China are in play this month, alongside a separate USTR action that targets Chinaâ€™s maritime/logistics/shipbuilding ecosystem. Beijing has already counter-moved with port fees on U.S. ships (waivers favor China-built tonnageâ€”this pushes ship routing & yard decisions and marginally tilts freight economics) and is litigating at the WTO, as predicted.Rare-earths/critical minerals tightness risk if counters escalate.Tariffs are a cost-pushâ€”headline effects first (goods/imports), with services less sensitive. Spring hikes already triggered Chinaâ€™s WTO case; a 100% rate would amplify pass-through unless offset by discounting/FX.

# Important trading advice + Intraday post (16/June)

> SPX is trading at 6013 while Iâ€™m writing these linesâ€¦

**Date:** unknown
**Source:** https://stochvoltrader.substack.com/p/important-trading-advice-intraday

Market analysisImportant trading advice + Intraday post (16/June)Jun 16, 2025âˆ™ Paid2051ShareSPX is trading at 6013 while Iâ€™m writing these linesâ€¦Here you can find the weekly post. On Friday, during the power hour I signaled that firms are buying and holding the index up. The setup into FOMC favors for reversion trades, a bit more edge on the long delta side. The key, I keep emphatizing for you, that you cannot beat the HF algos. There are two reasons for that: 1) Because, you cannot be that fast in terms of reading complex conditions, and fill trades; 2) Because you cannot be that emotionless, and disciplined. You will be distracted by win or loss.During the day there is only one intraday edge opportunity, two at max. Usually during the AM, and after 2 PM. In the first 20-30 min, intraday vol is high, bcs that when ppl are taking their 0DTE positions. You better watch during the first 30-40 min, and wait for the market to decide where it wants to go, and to build a structure (to have a retested support or resistance zone, to show its net drift, to unveil which effects are the most influential, etc.). You probably keep your spendings/incomes in check, so you know how much capital you should put into trading. If so, you should decide your daily budget, including your loss limit, and also your profit limit. Also you should decide, which side (long or short) you â€˜feelâ€™, which side you are familiar with to read, then based on the intraday setup, you should decide at what point and what conditions you will take your trade, and in what size. With this conscious planning you also determine, what conditions would disprove your trade and you take the loss. The next thing you need to do is to wait, wait and wait, until the market gives it to you. If it doesnâ€™t give it to you, donâ€™t fomo into the otherside, but wait for the next one or leave the desk, and leave it for tomorrow. You are not obligated to give your money to the market makers. The key is the careful and conscious planning, and to feel secure with it. You have to understand your decision, you have to be able to explain to yourself or to your wife, why you took that certain position. The worst that can happen is that you were wrong, and you took your loss within your limit. This is crucial, because insecurity leads to over-hesitation or to undisciplinated fomo-behavior.For fast jump-in trades, use market orders, for more calculated and patient trades, use limit orders. No trailing stop-loss. And when the trade goes into your favor, and momentum is proved, size up, and roll when the contract reaches 80-85 delta (roll back towards 50 delta). For intraday trading I like to use 60/70 delta ITM contracts due to the theta, and 50 delta ATMs when conviction is high. I use 22 delta OTMs for swing trades, with weekly expo at least. And if the MM positioning is short fly pattern, be fast out, because of higher theta bleed.Me personally, I trade a distribution, sizing based on the simulated probabilitity values, using my own modified Heston-Nandi for that, then size up on the winners and close the losers. Also DCAing only 3 times at max, when I bet on long vol (but mostly 2 legs). Reversion lvls, shared at the end of every posts, give you the probabilities. Positioning based leves are giving you the support/resistance zones, also levels where dynamics shifts. You should look for divergences. And the momentum script I shared with you, gives you a straight-forward clue about the current momentum. While the educational posts give you practical insights of risk management, position sizing, market phases and dynamics. Also showed how to create your own simulation using Excel, etc.These things are enough to beat the market. All you need to do is to draw the levels on the chart, take notes of the dynamics, and make a plan.Take your time. Be responsible and calculated.

Market analysisInflation expectations, Perspectives - Intraday post (12/08)Aug 12, 2025âˆ™ Paid101ShareHere is the weekly post: CPI and OpEx week - Weekly post (11/Aug - 15/Aug)AlmaÂ·August 10, 2025Read full storyMarket keeps trending at the centroid of the weekly OpEx positioning Everything depends on the sentiment, because market is up on earnings and Sept cut hopes. My job is to tell you what distribution the market prices and what happens in certain scenarios. Market cannot always be frontrunned, and predicted.Most of the times we can only determine the risk and hedge it, while simultaniously play the present moves just like we did last week with the bullish move. It is not a guessing-raceâ€¦ thatâ€™s a bad â€œfuruâ€ behaviorâ€¦The whole CPI and PPI release will reveal how much influence the government has on Fed.The question is if disinflation is happening or tariff generated pressures remain and create a sticky or even climbing inflation. Overall the market expects inflation on the front-end (1-3 year window) as a result of tariffs that will moderate later.The curve of inflation swaps are declined since QT in 2022, but seems like bottomed when the Fed first cut rates. In the April/May period, despite the recessionary and even temporal deflationary concerns, the market started to expect even higher inflation due to tariffs, and stagflationary pressures, meaning that the Fed wonâ€™t be able to handle both simultanously. I tell you what to look forâ€¦First, the market expects a neutral print, rather a hot or cold print. It expects sticky uncertainity, and most likely will wait until PPI and Jackson Hole, expanding my risk window. And OpEx will still cap the downside until. This is the marketâ€™s expectation. However, if the inflationary pressures are not significant, or even there is a small hint of cooling pressure, or turning towards disinflation (increased rate of cooling), if Sept cut happens, the market will take profit. Simply, because the Fed doesnâ€™t cut because of no-inflation risk, but because of slowing growth, political manipulation and growing debt burden. A hawkish, emergency cut, rather a green light. It would not be bearish, but correctiveâ€¦This is why the market is telling us that it is not happy about bad news at all: I wait until data releases, then reassume. For today, I show you what the market expects, and what is the plan untilâ€¦Let see what distribution and reactions the positioning impliesâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisIntraday post (02/April), Bulltrap? StagflationApr 02, 2025âˆ™ Paid1922ShareMarket is trading at 5600 during asiaâ€¦After my weekly post, we can see investors gravitating toward value stocks with lower beta, as a defense against further selloffs.As I keep saying, volatility is simply too high now in a short tenor, and market needs to solve first the liquidity issue before continuing its path to the downside. Thus, funds are in mean reversion mode during RTH.As RV comes down (still not visible in every metrics), the risk parity based funds slightly increase their long exposures, that provides a short-term support and bull-trap, until the adverse impact of tariffs on growth, corporate earnings, and consumption becomes apparent.  Treasury curves are bull-flattening, especially at the front-end. This, coupled with front-end real yields hitting new multi-year lows means that market is increasingly pricing in a slowdown in growth, while still expects higher inflation: This is what I keep talking about: stagflation. And this is what Trump needs to fight.

Market analysisIntraday post (02/May), NFPMay 02, 2025âˆ™ Paid141ShareNFP print today. Here you can get some educational content about it. Soft print gonna cause sell like 90-100 pts for ES.And current event summary.The May â€™25 SOFR futures contract is relatively flat, while longerâ€dated SOFR from September â€™25 through December â€™26 are rallyingâ€”signalling back-loaded Fed easing. Gold seems buy-the-dip setup into the summer.*update: Stronger-than-expected jobs gains and stable unemployment diminish near-term rate-cut bets, supporting Fed Chair Powellâ€™s commitment to hold rates at 4.25â€“4.50%Market will need to reprice itself thenâ€¦ get ready for liquidity hunt and reversion. Very much likelyhood. This beat isnâ€™t a green light for riskâ€on. Because a 177 000 payroll increase is 25% above the 12-month average of 152 000, and wage growth at 3.8% y/y underscores broad hiring and pay momentum. Meaning that, even amid policy shocks, firms continue â€œhoarding labor,â€ a hallmark of a strong economy. Despite market pressure for cuts, Powell has repeatedly emphasized data dependence and the Fedâ€™s higher-for-longer bias, warning that pre-emptive easing could reignite inflation . By beating jobs forecasts, Aprilâ€™s report further consolidates his authority to maintain rates until clear slack emerges, underscoring that markets must dance to Powellâ€™s tune.CME Fedâ€funds futures show June cut odds plummeting, with traders now pushing the first cut out to late 2025. However most of Aprilâ€™s hiring decisions occurred under preâ€tariff conditions, meaning the 177 000 payroll gain overstates underlying strength once tariffâ€driven headwinds fully materialize.

Market analysisIntraday post (03/April), Tariffs, FedApr 03, 2025âˆ™ Paid234ShareBefore you continue, make sure you are understand what I keep telling about geos and tariffs (all covered and linked in this post), to not believe what the media and furus are telling about this economic situation.  Yesterday I also showed you that everybody can see the stagflation already (that I keep writing about in the past 3 years).Trump dropped the tariffs (including the surprise that I promised, targeting the BRICS) SubscribeThis is just the beginning. (But donâ€™t forget that Trump is very much following  Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazermanâ€™s work the â€œNegotiation Geniusâ€.Now, before jumping in to the positioning, letâ€™s see, what the skew shows us. Friday expo: April OpEx: Quarterly: One word comes into my mind: complacency. The tails donâ€™t even bother. What we see is a â€œlong put spreadâ€ pattern, a long downside vol strategy, but no tail hedge. Tails almost always react for everythingâ€¦ but now, on the cliff of a new, uncertain worldorder, tariff war, and obvious stagflation, they donâ€™t move. My guess is that market is complacent about a supportive, dovish FOMC. But this decline is not enough for a significant negative wealth effect. And remember my geo post: the plan is to get a sustainable QE and growth, and Trump wants to kill stagflation. If QE would come now, weâ€™d get a new cycle just like it was 4-5 years ago. But FOMC is very much likely to wait, exactly because the inflation risk is still too high. â€œTrump putâ€ will come later. So I assume a very high chance that the market is too complancent about the left-tail. And the left-tail has never been the tariffs itself, but its consequences: Read my weekend postâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Final outcomes now depend on bilateral diplomacy, not unilateral tariff hikes. U.S. equities jumped roughly 3â€“4% on the pause news, lifting the S&P 500 to fresh highs within days. Quant models and momentum-based funds use measured-move targets; once that objective was reached, buying interest naturally waned. Fast moves tend to exhaust one-way flows, increasing the odds of a corrective pullback that â€œcools offâ€ excessive valuations.After an up-move, a base forms when supply and demand find equilibrium, often accompanied by declining volume, creating a launchpad for a sustainable advance. Prices trading sideways within a defined corridor signal indecision and allow volume and volatility to normalize before a breakout. A retracement off the high can help wash out weaker hands and test key support levels without invalidating the uptrend. Once a pullback establishes a higher-low above critical support, buyers regain confidence for the next pushâ€”avoiding â€œblow-offâ€ tops.5760 is critical pivot momentum wise for SPX, and bullish until 5580, same with 5783 for ES=F, and 5590. Momentum wise!For more quantitatively computed ranges, check the weekly post.NO HIGH CONVICTION LONG YETâ€¦ not rushingI see that I need to explain it again. As many of you know, I short VIX, short vol, and long delta for a while as a â€œhedgeâ€ while the risk/reward is on the short side.

Market analysisIntraday post (19/feb)Feb 19, 2025âˆ™ Paid1521ShareFirst, lets look at CME FedWatch tool: A quick walkthrough: Fed funds futures are quoted as 100 minus the expected effective rate: Implied Rate=100âˆ’Â Futures PriceFed always sets a target range for the fed funds rate. The FedWatch tool compares the implied rate to the current target range. If the implied rate is lower than the current range, the market expects rate cuts (or a lower effective rate), and if itâ€™s higher, it expects rate hikes.As cuts/hikes typically occur in increments of 25 basis points, the tool uses the difference between the implied rate and the current target rate (often the midpoint of the target range) to estimate the probability of a change. Of course, they consider the term structure of the futures, etc. So this way, looking at the current pricing of fed funds futures, the tool tells us how many basis points the market expects the fed funds rate to change by a given date.Here you can read their methodology more in depth. As you can see, market prices 97.5% probability for no cuts in March, 55.4% into June, and 18.6% into Dec, betting with 37% probability for a 25bps cut, and this is the highest bet. The sentiment turns in July. So basically the market only expects only one rate cut this year. Here I explained that the current higher inflation prints were natural and donâ€™t actually reflect the inflation trend. Of course, this reports are mostly fake, but we have to follow the narrative that they want to sell us, we canâ€™t be bearish if they want to boost the market and economy. The key takeaway here is that we already saw last week, that the market prices in sticky inflation, and doesnâ€™t really expect further easing. This is something to keep in mind, everything else is just temporal market speculation to collect premium and catch alpha through event vol spikes. Bad news are no news, but in an evironment like this, good news are very good news.

---

Market analysisIntraday post (20/May), Vix expoMay 20, 2025âˆ™ Paid12ShareBear market - biasHere is a summary of key points for my high probability bear market bias:Powell faces a noâ€‘win between cutting too soon (fueling inflation) or too late (triggering a pullâ€‘back). Higher import levies now hitting CPI, yet high rates wonâ€™t blunt costâ€‘push inflation.Warehouses are near capacity even as demand slows, squeezing margins and retail credit quality. Q1 saw vacancy tick up to 7% even as new supply slows, a sign inventories are piling up. Target and Walmart hiked inventories by 7â€¯%/2.8% ahead of tariffs, then saw gross margins compress. 90â€‘day creditâ€‘card delinquency jumped to 12.3%, while overall serious delinquencies climbed from 2% to 2.8% in Q1.Growth slowing with commodity prices down, but persistent inflation keeps real GDP growth subdued. A large June refinance of maturing debt and an unresolved debtâ€‘ceiling fight threaten market liquidity and Treasury yields. Markets expect rate cuts only â€œafter unemployment hitsâ€ and data turnâ€”yet cuts too early risk reigniting inflation. 90â€‘day US/CN truce = supply shock, bcs pausing new tariffs doesnâ€™t remove duties already in place; goods prices rose 0.2% m/m in April CPI. Reduced sailings and port congestion pushed container rates to multiâ€‘year highsâ€”even as global PMI shows only modest easing in supplyâ€‘chain pressures.Tariffâ€‘shock effects on margins, credit, and growth can trigger sizable drawdowns (even 30%)â€”but only if data confirm a oneâ€‘two punch of slowdown plus sticky prices.Next weekâ€™s gonna be vol driven, likely vol down, spot up slow grind.*Note, if it turns out to be right that it is a bearmarket rally, what it implies is that in a bear market one should be very adaptive. While in a bull market one simply buys every dips, during a bear market you look for reversion trades and headlines and bonds in order to determine entries and exists. (Not shortin every tops, like my would think.) Bear market requires high ability to be adaptive. If you are unsecure about it, better wait for a clear setup.

Market analysisIntraday post (21/march) + OpExMar 21, 2025âˆ™ Paid1711ShareIn this post you can read the overall bias from geo perspective. Crucial.This is the weekly post, covering the weekly positioning and more geo context.In this post I covered how the greeks interact near to expo (gamma, vega, vanna and charm).And this is from yesterday where I covered the current Fed and the tech situation.Very important to read through them.After Thursdayâ€™s price action, the SPX would need a roughly 4% rally to trigger both medium-term and short-term systematic buying levels. Once that occurs, nearly $70â€¯billion of U.S. equities could be unlocked for purchase. Despite recent declines, market breadth is strongâ€”which isnâ€™t surprising if you understand the context I keep writing about.On the institutional side, however, hedge fund gross leverage is at an allâ€‘time high. When prices dip, forced deâ€‘grossing (i.e., selling) may happen, making trading choppy. The ratio of short sales to long sales is about 5.2 to 1, meaning there are over five short sales for every long sale. This large imbalance reflects a heavy bear skew in market sentiment. Of the 11 U.S. sectors, 7 were net sold. The recent drop in U.S. Fundamental L/S Net leverage to roughly two-year lows shows that the overall aggressiveness of long and short positions has fallen sharply.More importantly, the aggregate long/short ratio (longs divided by shorts) has hit its lowest level in over five years. The top sectors being sold were Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Financialsâ€”generally more cyclical or growth-oriented.All in all, the market remains full of uncertainty and high institutional leverage.In April, there are new tariffs scheduled for April 2nd and 15th, and Trump has already started discussing nuclear issues with Iran, which is a highly sensitive topic.Thereâ€™s talk on Wall Street that real QE might arrive in May. I think this is still early, but if everything goes according to plan, itâ€™s possibleâ€”though the market must drop significantly first. Meanwhile, funds plan to offset their significant losses through tax loss harvesting around April OpEx weekâ€”no coincidence there.A personal meeting between Putin and Trump is scheduled for after Ramadan and Eid.Volatility on a fixed-strike basis has significantly decreased going into April, and the skew is shorter. Complacency is always what leads to sharp declines, not when the market is hedged.Iâ€™m not sure what will happen between March OpEx and end of month. For now, Iâ€™m taking it day by day. But in any case, the bottom isnâ€™t in yetâ€”only a temporary one. Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Intraday post (22/April)

**Date:** unknown

Market analysisIntraday post (22/April)Apr 22, 2025âˆ™ Paid112ShareWeekly post is here, very importantâ€¦ as alwaysâ€¦Investor confidence continues to weaken, and further capital is being withdrawn.At the heart of that distrust lies the belief that China holds a stronger hand than the U.S., and since Americaâ€™s risk/reward profile is less favorable, investors expect the U.S. to fold before Chinaâ€”despite its significantly stronger economy and military.China has thrown down the gauntlet and keeps sending the world that message.And that is a question no one can answerâ€”not even the intelligence agenciesâ€”because no one can see both sidesâ€™ cards, exact reserves, and psychological strengths in their entirety.In any case, money is still flowing out of the U.S. economy.U.S. equity ETFs saw $10.62 billion of net outflows in the week to April 16, reflecting broad riskâ€‘off sentiment. Foreign investors alone dumped $6.5 billion of U.S. equities over the five trading sessions ending April 10U.S. bond funds suffered $10.07 billion of outflows in the week to April 16, while global bond funds lost $19.96 billion, marking their worst week since 2020, n the prior week to April 9, U.S. bond funds posted their largest weekly outflows since December 2022 at $15.64 billion.U.S. shortâ€‘term government bond funds (Tâ€‘bill ETFs) attracted $7.1 billion in the week to April 16, as investors parked cash in ultraâ€‘safe paper and global moneyâ€‘market funds saw $122.96 billion of net withdrawals in that same period. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index slumped to 97.923 on April 21â€”its weakest since March 2022â€”as investors balk at U.S. political and tradeâ€‘policy risks.U.S. twoâ€‘year swap spreads briefly inverted to â€“46 bp, their tightest since November 2024, signalling acute stress in the interbank market.Swapâ€‘line usage is ver low, indicating no active dollarâ€‘liquidity support via foreign central banks. The Fedâ€™s Overnight Reverseâ€‘Repo (RRP) facility still absorbs about $114.114 billion of cash daily (April 21, 2025) as moneyâ€‘market funds and other counterparties park excess liquidity. Award rate remains at 4.25%Fed is effectively â€œsterilizingâ€ treasury supply and keeping its balance sheet runoff on autopilot. When foreign investors sell U.S. Treasuries, the dollars they receive often flow into moneyâ€‘market vehicles, which in turn park those funds in the RRP facilityâ€”so in that sense, the Fed â€œabsorbsâ€ the cash freed up by Treasury sales. Elevated RRP balances therefore signal that cash is being withdrawn from private lending markets (and indirectly from Treasury holdings) and parked at the Fed instead.Also the Standing Repo Facility remain operational, and discountâ€‘window drawdowns are minimalâ€”no sign of expanded backstops yet. Repo purchases are low.Meanwhile, Europe is preparing for easing. Please understand the poker game at work hereâ€”that is the key. I have laid it out.

Market analysisIntraday post (23/June)Jun 23, 2025âˆ™ Paid91ShareWeekly post is out. SubscribeI see people keep being lost in the noise of the spot moves, assigning too much significance to random 10 pts moves. My job as an analyst is to find the levels and the moves that actually matter from sentiment and dynamics perspective, and that have predictive matter in terms of the expected flows. Also knowing the hedging dynamics or skew mechanisms donâ€™t matter at all in itself, wonâ€™t tell you anything about what the market wants. But reading between the lines, check the timing of a certain change, researching what is the actual underlying story that the market wants to tell us and then compare the changes in the output numbers of different metrics, will reveal where the flow wants to flow, and will give you estimations, distribution or a direct path. But one needs a creative approach, a creative mind. It is something that is over the algorhytmic thinking. Check the educational postsâ€¦ Also, here I shared some free trading advice for you all.

This is a red flag, but only a faint red one. I wrote that the probability of risk window shifted to the post-FOMC/OpEx window, but it is not a 0-100% probability, but like 40-60%. My advice is always: never be married to a bias. And donâ€™t expect me to tell you what this market will do exactly. Especially now. Iâ€™m unsure too. I only know what to watch, and when the picture clears out I will knowâ€¦ For now we must watch how things evolve around momentum is evolving around key zones. And knowing what the key zones mark, we can gain informations about the momentum. This is why I donâ€™t take any longer-term positions yet.The mean reversion signal from last week is there. Market is at extremes. And risk probability is way above 0%, but lower than a potential Sept risk window. I explained this in the weekly post. So keep your eyes open. Structure is supported. For now, there is no catalyst on the horizont for a sell-off/breaking through the vol based structure. But the marketâ€™s main bet is ranging with a slight positive drift not a rally or a sell-off. Keep your eyes open for longer-term trades, and wait for NVDA ER, market is very concentrated.As said: market is not always predictable. Now, this is the time to watch and read the tape until the momentum clears out.

Market analysisIntraday post (26/march), vol comparsion, long gamma tradebear trap and bull trap into Rosh Chodesh Nisan?Mar 26, 2025âˆ™ Paid1753ShareIn this weekly post I convered the base, initial context that we should take as the initial point when we are making comparsions or monitoring the changes. Also convered the JPM collar hedge. Recent indications suggest that the â€œbearâ€‘caseâ€ for tariffs is being moderated. If tangible tariff details are released on 2nd of April, there can be significant clarity for corporate planning. This can help dampen volatility and long squeeze UST and short squeeze SPX.I will drop a new geo post soon, but now in short:History shows that Russia has been most successful in its geopolitical struggles when the West was divided.During the Great Northern War, Peter the Greatâ€™s Russia exploited divisions within Europeâ€™s anti-Swedish coalition; in the Napoleonic Wars, Russia allied with Great Britainâ€”usually a rivalâ€”to defeat France. In World War II, the Soviet Union benefited from divisions between the USA and Germanyâ€™s former allies.Conversely, when the West acted as a unified entity, Russia had to face its greatest challengesâ€”such as during the Cold War, which ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.In light of these historical lessons, it would be unwise for Moscow to ignore the potential for accelerating the rift between Washington and its European allies.Russia must continue cooperating with Trumpâ€™s team while indirectly supporting those European voices that advocate a more balanced approach toward Russia. Moscow must deepen its bilateral economic relations with individual European countries, circumventing Brusselsâ€™ restrictive policies wherever possible. It should also closely monitor any serious Western European attempts to create an independent military bloc.Crucial to understand.Letâ€™s check the skew, how it progressed during the week.This is SPX skew 1 week ago: And currently: Into this Friday expo the skew became longer by 10.30%, with put/ATM skew bid by 5.08% and call/ATM offered by -5.22% (Note also that April OpEx skew is also getting longer.) Besides call selling, we can see some significant increase on the tails even compared to yesterday: But call selling is coming back into EOM expo: For bulls, it is very important to holdâ€™nâ€™close above 5710.25 into the weekend in order to not let downside vol to get realizedâ€¦ Iâ€™ll tell you why I smell bear trap here, but nowâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisIntraday post (28/April)Apr 28, 2025âˆ™ Paid2216ShareHere is the big summary post about all these events that most of you is lost in, and the expectations. Always zoom out btw. Read it!Iâ€™m expecting a very short-term, buyable dip around mid-week into next weekâ€”but donâ€™t get married to the upside. Like I said, any upside is a right-tail event that I hedge; the base case is still down for the overall trend. That said, events will matter in how they play out. Market has no real support.This isnâ€™t an investorsâ€™ market right now, itâ€™s a tradersâ€™ marketâ€”so be adaptive and versatile, or better yet, sit in cash until things clear up. You arenâ€™t forced to try to surf every wave out of pointless recklessness. It wonâ€™t make you any less of a personâ€”if anything, youâ€™ll be more thoughtful if you properly admit and size up the risks.And Iâ€™d also like to remind you that Iâ€™m personally not optimistic about global events, as Iâ€™ve already explained. However, I strive to describe the probability distribution of those events and their implications in a factual way. Itâ€™s not my job to blind you with my own personal bias.***Bessent performed a nice stand-up yesterday, and on his twitter platform. He defended Trumpâ€™s volatile tariff strategy as deliberate â€œstrategic uncertainty,â€ calling it a game-theoretic tool that gives the U.S. maximum leverage over trading partners. He framed it as using both â€œthe stickâ€ of steep levies and â€œthe carrotâ€ of potential relief. Bessent also pushed back on gloomy market headlinesâ€”pointing out that the Nasdaq is up for April despite reports of it being the worst April since the Depression. He said he didnâ€™t know if Trump had spoken with Xi, only that his own talks with Chinaâ€™s treasury team focused on financial-stability issues. He reaffirmed there is a path to de-escalation and used social media to broadcast the same â€œleverageâ€ message.Wellâ€¦1) Tariffs have pressured both ends of that barbellâ€”tech and energy stocks have seen large swings amid supply-chain shocks and commodity volatility. Game-theory â€œstrategic uncertaintyâ€ (the stick-and-carrot tariff threats) may create negotiation leverage, but it also injects acute volatility into asset prices, exactly as markets have endured;2) Freight-volume collapses (imports down ~36â€“43%â€¦ and even worse based on my algos, but donâ€™t want to make you panic), blanked sailings, and layoffs in logistics presage real economic dragâ€”far beyond the veneer of market-level reassurance. Even Fed Governor Waller called the tariff shock â€œone of the biggest shocksâ€¦ in many decades,â€ warning it could have long-lasting impacts on output and employment;3) As I keep telling you, this rebound is driven by short-covering and liquidity injections from algorithmic traders (+retail FOMO), not by renewed fundamental confidence+ you know, in a freight-shock, tariff-hit market, holes appear in the tapeâ€”periods with no resting bidsâ€”so a TWAP order can push prices artificially higher (or lower), producing a misleading fake bounceâ€¦ these algos slice large orders into equal pieces over time to minimize market impact;4) The next de minimis deadline (May 2) and potential further tariff announcements mean fresh supply shocks will hit just as seasonal liquidity ebbs. Stagflation and recession risks surging, driven in large part by tariffs and policy uncertainty. Summer months typically see lower trading volumes and higher volatility, exacerbating any underlying stress.Get it? This is how you should read itâ€¦ SubscribeCoding positioning for today session:Behind the bearish positioning, speed profile is positive both locally and on a net base.Lets recall, positive speed is higher upside gamma, lower downside gamma. With that said, lower vol up, higher vol down. In other words: more artificial liquidity up, and less artificial liquidity down. From a momentum perspective this means stabilizing upward, and accelerating downward (left-tail risk). This is called a positive vanna environment. But also, charm is net negative, meaning dealers getting shorter delta in every five minutes, forcing them to buyback. Any deviation from these theoretical flows (that are manifested in volatility) reveal the real hands of the underlying customer flows.

Market analysisIntraday vol breakdown + Intraday post (14/May) Speed profile with intraday vol breakdownMay 14, 2025âˆ™ Paid204ShareWeekly post is here.CPI preview and review is posted here below the paywall.After tariff relief, many strategists cut recession odds and turned bullish, forecasting only modest corrections, a broad consensus of a ~10 % rebound by end-2025, warning investors â€œdonâ€™t buy the hypeâ€ of deeper sell-offs.However, lingering risks in trade-war dynamics is still there, despite the rally, meaning that any failure to extend or honor the pause, and if the Fed mishandles rate-cut expectations, can trigger sharp, even bigger reversal.  QT regime along with maturing balanceâ€sheet rollâ€offs pull liquidity out, thereâ€™s far less dry powder to absorb shocks. Also note, that weâ€™re hitting the fiveâ€year milestone of debt and equity refinancings, and the resulting cashâ€scarcity is a major hidden vulnerability.You have to understand that structural forces fundamentally determine the distribution and risk premia. This is why it is important to assign a narrative to this current short vol-driven relief-rally. Stagflation is masked now, sentiment-wise. Market misprices the current state, and the risk of the looming bear market. As you already know, I expect May OpEx to be supportive, especially now as SPX is trading above the key levels while volatility is keep grinding lower. I see the OpEx as the possible peak. Heavy reliance on T-bills means rollover risk is rising, putting upward pressure on yields and downward on asset prices if new buyers donâ€™t step up.But I will wait for the signal of the model to go above 80% probability.

Market analysisJuly Monthly Outlook, Vol of vol supply, Momentum - Equilibrium + Weekly post (07-11/July)Momentum, Market Equilibrium, Bias, July positioning, Vol dynamics, Weekly expected dynamics, My trading stratJul 07, 2025âˆ™ Paid3136ShareBearmarket odds have decreased drastically for now, even tho the risk is still not 0%. Note, that August - Sept window is still a pivot, but probability is lower. The reason is not the momentum but strictly the sentiment, because we can see that the market is aggressively held-up, and very much likely that it will remain so until the problems get solved even only on paper. Then the market will rebalance itself just like as it did after 2021. The reason for that is that the market is very vulnerable and both the economic growth and investor sentiment is dancing on the edge of the cliff. And like that, any major weakness would cause big problems. Look at SPX recovery after the COVID-crash: There were five pullbacks that where higher than 6% on the way up, cooling off the volatility by â€œwaiting for the liquidity left behindâ€, and to build a stable structure after it took back the losses by two 8-10% corrections, before started to rally. The Fed was there with QE, liquidity was stimulated. Now, look at this rebound: We only got one 6% pullback after the drawdown, but later on the way up, it didnâ€™t even performed a 3.84% pullback that would have been at least in ratio with COVID momentum. This is a different, and very aggressive regime, especially if you consider that the Fed is not fully behind this move. Using simple technical meassurements, a ~6360 blowoff top is likely before, the SPX sees a major 6-10% pullback (both offer nice buying opportunity), and coincidencing with two very important liquidity zones. Iâ€™ll tell you, why they are important, and how can this scenario play out, and what the market expects about it. But first, I need to write a bit about the mean reversion theory from a perspective to explain why your eyes can cheat you when you look at the chartâ€¦ SubscribeMARKET EQUILIBRIUMIf you have read my Educational Posts, I wrote more posts about market theories and anomalies. This is key for both analysts and traders to understand.  The market is always about to find equilibrium, but it always creates disbalances. First there is the growth, because the economy is growing, the performance is growing, the prices are growing, market is growing. But then there is the momentum effect, because of the speculative trades, leverage and the reinvestment of the leverage to create more leverage, and also because of the general sentiment that overvalues any directions. This builds a disbalance in the returns. Momentum effect is basically â€œcrowding upâ€ the right-tail or the left-tail constantly, creating a reflexive effect to realize it. And note, that historical skewness of SPX is also oscillating around its equilibrium net negative estimation! â€¦it keeps re-centering itself around its longer-term mean that is net negative holding an equilibrium skew bias, as you can see below: (You can observe how the shorter-term averages are also oscillating around the longer-term averages.) However, the market will eventually rebalance these accumulated disbalances. But not in a way that many people thinks! Because price action has two dimension: the price level axis (y-axis, vertical), and time axis (x-axis, horizontal). And just like the two sides of a right-angle, if the horizontal leg gets longer, while the vertical leg keeps its height, the slope of the hypotenuse will be lower, than if the horizontal leg would be shorter. The slopeness is mathematically measured by the vertical leg-to-horizontal leg ratio, that is the same as Newtonâ€™s formula for velocity, where horizontal axis represents the time and the vertical axis represents the displacement. And in terms of price actions, velocity is indirectly refers to volatility, and as a result it also reflects the level of liquidity (inversely, see the post). Well, market can functionate only if there is liquidity, so the providers are keep rebalancing it time-to-time, as necessary. As a result, volatility exhibits strong mean reverting behavior. This behavior is even stronger than what is exhibited by the price actions, that follow rather a positive-drifted special random walk with both momentum and mean reversion behaviors. However, this liquidity-rebalancing act that keeps the volatility mean reverting, is also reflected in the returns at some point when one scrutinizes its movements. Here you can see the relative logreturns of the SPX. (By relative, I mean that the code compares the individual returns to the average return. Simply because a daily return of 1% has different meanings if the monthly average return is 0.3% or 2.8%) On the cyan colored histogram, you can see the positive-negative imbalances of the SPX returns. Now letâ€™s look at the relative momentum of the SPX, I coded: Everywhere where the purple line crossed the horizontal, the momentum found equilibrium. I projected the price levels and dates where these modelled equilibriums occured: As you can see these are not always coincidenc with market tops and bottoms. Sometimes they do, but in a significant amount of times they donâ€™t. Why? - Because it is not the price level that rebalances itself (especially because the market is growing), but it is the liquidity! This is a common trap that many people falsely assume when they meassure a steep trend: it may be steep to your eyes, but liquidity already found equilibrium. Crucial.Now, go back to the relative SPX momentum chart (just right above this one). You see a relatively high positive disbalance. This can rebalance itself down in two ways: a high vol sudden crash (very unlikely), or simply slowing trend in time, that can be 1) choppy, or 2) upward drifting oscillation. It can take weeks until the purple line touches zero, and only after then it can start to accumulate negative disbalances (later in this post, I will tell you the level that would shift the momentum of the purple line). If you scroll back up to the relative logreturns chart, you will see a similar indications: the returns actually have some negative equilibrium (pretty counter-intuitive, right?) and both seemingly and mathematically (cyclically) seems like going back to the positive territory. (later Iâ€™ll tell you the estimated time of the cycle shift).So the key is, that price action is two dimensional. And so, the equilibrium can be found on both axis. If we look at the volatility, it definitely overshooted and accumulated some negative equilibrium, but not as much as many would first think: Letâ€™s look at its momentum: It still have room to grow. I estimate around 16.88 - 20.73% range currently, where it can grind back up. The exact magnitude would depend if vol of vol remains supplied, because then time would help to find liquidity earlier.However it could still produce a 5.79 - 7.11% pullback in the next 1.5 - 2 monthly window. The higher end is close to what is technically estimated in average.The key takeaway here is that liquidity imbalances (volatility over/undersupply) is what moves the market. News, Fed, ERs, datas, timed announcements are only there to amplify momentums on the short run (quarterly - yearly window). Events generate liquidity and liquidity generates momentum. Momentum produces gains. On the long-run however the market rebalances its valuation. This is what Benjamin Graham called as the â€œweighing machineâ€â€¦ SENTIMENT AND BUFFETT INDICATORThe bearmarket risk arises from the fact that the April drawdown was caused by investors, not traders, and the positive imbalance and overvaluation is relatively significant in a multi yearly window. As the market is held up aggressively and artificially (including pumping the â€œvoting machineâ€), even if the recession is bottomed (likely), the market will revaluate itself. Currently I donâ€™t see that Trump will let it happen. He and the banks, investement funds have every tool to make it growing even on paper until the underlying problems are tempered enough to be revealed. However, the underlying sentiment based on economic uncertainity is very pessimistic. Junk bond spreads and margin debt are grinding upward, while valuation models show extremely overvalued conditions. What I think is that bearmarket can be pushed farther in time (like into 2026), but based on cyclical analysis, I see it coming, and my estimation that at the end it will take back the fake pumped stagflationary gains since 2020 March-April.Like P/E ratio shows dot-com bubble levels, after that a multi-year bearmarket followed. This level was first hit in Dec of 2021. And just right before April, and currently trading at that. On an interest yields level, market is also overvalued, but it still has some room. (Higher interest rates lowe the profit of the firms, that will lower stock prices.) If we take sales datas we can meassure the stock price relative to the sales too (cannot be as easly manipulated as earnings). For now stocks are way overpriced relative to their sales too. Above the dot-com bubble era. The Buffett-indicator takes the ratio of the Total US Market Value to the GDP, that is â€œprobably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given momentâ€: Buffett Indicator=MarketCapGDP=$62.79T$29.96T=0.21This means that the current value is 209.53%, signaling extreme overvaluation.The â€œbeautyâ€ of this metric is that if GDP growth slows down, the indicator will naturally rise, meaning that there is a smaller economic base for the same equity value.Beside these valuation metrics, market breadt, put/call ratio, market momentum and simple sentiment meassures show extreme greed, foreshadowing a pullback. But the valuation models show that the weighing machine is slowly turns on. In the short-term, If the market pulls back, as it should to build a stable structure and liquidity zone higher, BTC will also fall. I currently estimate it to 40-60k, but I will cover it later in a separated post. As the economy is planned to be tokenized in the next 5-6 years, I will handle BTC and ETH as an investment from here. For now, I donâ€™t make longer-term swing trades, even if the momentum points up in the very near-term. I need to see, how equilibrium is built, because momentum doesnâ€™t signals immediate pullback, risk is there and growing (especially if spot up/vol up blow-offtop happens), while revaluation is likely coming in the next yearly windows (or later this year - way less likely but not zero %). I hedge the downside risk based on my probability estimations, scaling out the short-vol and long delta positions and wait. No need to trade constantly. If I see some nice intraday setup, I jump in for a fast trade. Now, letâ€™s scrutinize, what the market actually bets on for this window, and I will tell you what the time series analysis told and what probability I got.

Educational postsLiquidity structure | Let's put speed profile into contextBasic concepts, Liquidity, TPO chart, Speed profileJan 07, 2026âˆ™ Paid4046ShareDuring the 2021 GameStop gamma squeeze, the retail crowd discovered the options market and the hedging activity of market makers. The newly discovered â€œlow â€“ the idea that options positioning can directly impact the price of the underlying asset â€“ went through multiple, almost conspiratorial misinterpretations. On the back of this, a lot of furus jumped into building gamma/delta etc. data-providing services, operating on the old â€œsell shovels during a gold rushâ€ principle.Market makers started to be wrapped in a kind of mystique, as if they were the shadowy masterminds controlling the market. In furu circles, anyone who branded themselves as an â€œexâ€“market makerâ€ could expect instant popularity, because the retail herd felt that one of these supposedly all-knowing, anointed high priests of the market had arrived to reveal the big secrets. In other words, they thought theyâ€™d found the free lunch.These furus try to explain everything with dealer flows and with the derivative functions of the Blackâ€“Scholes pricing model, no matter the cost. Meanwhile, a big percent of the retail crowd has lost touch with the actual reality of how markets function. The more someone throws around terms like â€œskewâ€, â€œvannaâ€, â€œvolgaâ€, â€œgammaâ€, â€œfixed-strike volâ€, â€œopex flowsâ€, etc. in ever more convoluted contexts, the more convincingly they can sell themselves to retail as some omniscient professor â€“ while in fact giving completely unrealistic and false explanations of what market-maker positioning data is actually for, and why specific price moves happen.In doing so, they effectively neutralize a very valuable tool (such as what OptionsDepth provides) by attaching a useless and unrealistic meaning to it.The goal of my current educational series is to steer my subscribersâ€™ thinking back toward practical use, and to show how positioning data complements the trading and analytical methods that legendary momentum traders have used for decades. Iâ€™ll start with the core concepts and how to apply them, the way I learned them from my former english mentor, who himself was one of the protÃ©gÃ©s of a well-known â€˜Market Wizardâ€™ (and with whom I was lucky enough, to spend three hours like 10+ years ago, talking about markets and trading strategy).Later, Iâ€™ll move on to the mathematical concepts, such as distributions and derivative functions (the Greeks), and Iâ€™ll show precisely how positioning data can be used by non-institutional traders to improve their trading. And I want to stress this: this is for non-institutional traders.

Market analysisLondon summit - geo post, Intraday post (23/April) Apr 23, 2025âˆ™ Paid19ShareInvestors still donâ€™t trust Trump, and momentum remains well inside the rangebound zone I marked. Yesterday, a flurry of TSLA calls boosted the tape and some manipulative trades tried to jack up sentiment on a few headlinesâ€”but remember: no real progress was made. If anything, things look worse. That random gap-up came out of nowhere; it wonâ€™t hold any weight until the SPX convincingly breaks out of its range, stabilizes, the VIX drops back below 20, and we see actual progession on the US/EU/CN front.Think macro for a secondâ€¦ global peace and prosperity come from cooperation and shared ideals, yet todayâ€™s West treats every interactionâ€”trade, diplomacyâ€”as a zero-sum game. Countries build financial, military, cultural, even physical walls, viewing interdependence and multilateral institutions as threats, not assets. This mindset accelerates arms races and raises the risk of outright war.The London summit is underway, but its status has been downgraded to lower-level officials after heavy hitters like Secretary of State Marco Rubio bowed out. Thereâ€™s been no genuine cease-fire breakthroughâ€”just a theater of unity. Behind closed doors, U.S. envoys will keep quietly negotiating with the Kremlin, and Trump will likely distance himself from the formal peace process. He will go to Middle-East mid-May. Very important event.Meanwhile, Russia is cranking up drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, seizing territory in Donetsk and pounding civilian infrastructureâ€”proof that Moscow expects minimal pushback, especially as NATO splinters along ideological lines. All signs point to Trump quietly backing away; investors donâ€™t believe he can rein in the globalist power structure. But remember, if he somehow did, nearly every U.S. tariff would be rolled back overnight.No meaningful deal is possible without concessions Ukraine and its European backers have already categorically rejected. The financial and military burden now falls heavily on EU membersâ€”Spain alone has committed â‚¬10.5 billion to meet NATOâ€™s 2 percent-of-GDP defense benchmark, and Portugal is scrambling for fiscal wiggle room. That strain will soon become untenable.In truth, Londonâ€™s gathering is little more than a showpiece masking a renewed great-power rivalry. Itâ€™s critical to follow todayâ€™s and this weekendâ€™s developments in that broader context.

Market analysisMarket analysisOverview of recent events, principles, and weekly postApr 25, 2025âˆ™ Paid68128ShareThe risk in the current situation, then, is that the entire global security architecture has been shakenâ€”and no one can say for sure whether this tremor is merely temporary or the beginning of a much larger tectonic shift.The momentum is real; it truly has deep causes. The question is whether a transformation can happen without an earthquake. In any case, the world order will be radically reshapedâ€”both economically and geopolitically.Today I marked a very pivotal event in terms of sentiment: the Putinâ€“Witkoff meeting. And despite this morningâ€™s assassination of Putinâ€™s lieutenant generalâ€”killed by a car bombâ€”the negotiations were quite benign/promising.After the close, I once again explained why macro matters. Most people simply arenâ€™t used to a market where the fundamentals are being shaken. Youâ€™re accustomed to a well-supported market riding a growth trajectory driven by fundamental supply and demand among investors, where prices sometimes diverge (catching momentum), and then inevitably mean-revert. You learn to estimate those anomalies through options and volatility positioning, and speculate on them. (Among retails, this way of thinking is particularly widespreadâ€”mainly because most of them came up in the cryptocurrency market and therefore only know a purely speculative mindset on a purely speculative market.)But that isnâ€™t always how things work. INVESTMENT (big boys mindset) Iâ€™ve already written about the marketâ€™s fundamental driving principles. At root, these come down to the price levels at which investors are willing to buy or sell. They have various methods for determining those levels, which Iâ€™ve also outlined briefly. Liquidity providers balance supply and demand (especially against speculative flows), while investors finance companiesâ€™ operations and a countryâ€™s debt, thereby supporting growth. But sometimes a particular event will create uncertainty among investorsâ€¦When that happens, serious problems arise both in the market and in the broader economy. If investors pull out, no one remains to finance either the governmentâ€™s spending and economic growth. That leads to a general slowdownâ€”and in some cases a deflationary spiral. The withdrawal of investorsâ€™ capital causes a massive liquidity drain in the markets, driving prices sharply lower and triggering a chain reaction of margin calls. That deleveraging event then removes even more money from the economy, producing a negative-wealth effect that further depresses prices (a disinf-/deflationary force).In such situations, it falls to the government to rescue the economy through both fiscal and monetary measures. First, by deploying various emergency mechanisms (which Iâ€™ve also described briefly). And second, by restoring investor confidence. It must pinpoint why investors are withdrawing and address that root problemâ€”offering them a deal that draws them back, convinces them their capital is safe, and makes financing government spending worthwhile. It is important to note that, investors never â€œshortâ€ their finances; they always go long. To invest is to finance a companyâ€™s or a governmentâ€™s operations because you believe in its growth. In return, the company or state rewards you with â€˜dividendsâ€™ paid from that growth. (They only enter into speculative trades if theyâ€™re setting aside money for hedging purposes or if they want to make a little side income. But I can tell you for fact that most of them suck at speculative trading.)Many people simply arenâ€™t familiar with this.LAST YEARâ€™S BIG SHORT SQUEEZELast year, the market was simply being artificially stimulated. I wrote several posts about this around Februaryâ€“March. It was an election year, and the Fed openly stated that it would prioritize economic growth over fighting inflation. The surface narrative was â€œelection year,â€ but the underlying story was the USâ€“China economic cold war unfolding behind the scenesâ€”one of the very principles of the â€œTrump tradeâ€ (as I pointed out in February, Wall Street would back him to secure that victory).That rally was built on a short squeeze. Why? Because everyone by then could clearly see the economy headed toward stagflationâ€”since the Fed in 2022 had shied away from aggressively tackling supply-sideâ€“driven inflation (precisely due to the USâ€“China cold war, waiting for China to slip into recession)â€”so they were shorting the risk of an actual QT. Yet the Fed itself was effectively short OTM puts at the bottoms and short ATM calls at the tops, creating a rangebound environment. On top of balance-sheet reduction, it was also buying massive amounts of MBS. It wasnâ€™t genuine QT.Once the Fed committed to artificially stimulating growth, those shorts began to be squeezed out. Thanks to the nature of the derivatives markets, that unleashed very strong buyback flowsâ€”and that became the foundation of the â€œgrowthâ€. Speculative, highly leveraged trades piled on with the AI bubble. The market would occasionally overshoot the curve of this artificial growth, and then mean-revert. The standout event came in August, when the market unwound a large, purely speculative gainâ€”unsupported by real investor convictionâ€”after a powerful gamma squeeze. Even that, however, was ultimately just mean reversion on a higher timeframe. It was triggered at the institutional level becauseâ€”as I repeatedly notedâ€”the Fed needed room to cut rates, which the negative wealth effect could provide. But I also warned it wouldnâ€™t be real QE, since a lowâ€rate regime amid stagflation isnâ€™t sustainable.Sure enough, the rate cut happened, then Trumpâ€™s election victory followed. On December 5, I signaled that the marketâ€™s reaction was unhealthy and that both fundamental and structural issues were piling up. Once again, I was proven right: the market began a controlled decline. I then predicted that the December Fed meeting would turn hawkish due to stagflation pressuresâ€”and it did, with the market giving back several hundred points in minutes. A nice, memorable day, indeed.But even that was still a form of mean reversion. By then, the first genuine fundamental problems had begun to surface.AFTER 2025 FEBRUARY (investigating the trend)In January, we bought the dip. But the situation was starting to look problematic. It became clear that Trump wasnâ€™t interested in boosting growth at all costsâ€”he wanted something more sustainable and realistic. Investors like that; speculators, not so much. Thatâ€™s when I launched the Substack and called for a day-by-day approach with long bias. I repeatedly stressed that things were changing, and the story the market was trying to tell was growing murky, so we need to be patient until the story unfolds. One thing I was sure of: Trump intended to buy out Chinaâ€™s role in the tech sector. I said this several times. So, ahead of the February OpEx on Wednesday, we shortedâ€”and the market did begin to fall, albeit slowlyâ€¦I noticed the down-move was manipulative: daily short speed positionings, a relatively low-variance declineâ€”what I called â€œspot decay,â€ or  â€œoscillation with negative drift.â€ That struck me as suspicious. A true analyst doesnâ€™t just describe what happensâ€”thatâ€™s mere commentary anyone can do after reading a couple of books. To front-run a market trend, you must understand what the market is really doing, what its narrative is, and thereby being able to project what comes next.So I asked myself: whatâ€™s going on? I concluded that this low-variance environment prevented hedges from printing enough, allowing insiders to probe margin levels and steadily accumulate (buying sold shares) as the market stepped down. That explained why Trump surrounded himself with wealthy billionaires in and around his administration. (Once the market operation concluded, those individuals would quietly receive new positionsâ€”Elon Musk among them, and indeed, itâ€™s already unfolding.)I began digging into exactly whom they intended to buy out, so I could pinpoint the sectors, companies, equities (and derivatives) to watch for trend analysis. As I dove deeper, insider sources came forward with help. I already knew about Trumpâ€™s 2019 outreach to Russia and his plan to buy out China. I analyzed those trends back then and profited handsomely. Then, in late February, I was told that this plan had resurfaced: Kirill Dmitriev had met with Trumpâ€”before his inaugurationâ€”to discuss building a US-Russia-Middle East alliance, which I dubbed â€œHoly Alliance 2.0â€ after the 1815 historical coalition. Iâ€™ve described that plan in detail multiple times; the post is pinned in the â€œMarket Analysisâ€ section for anyone to find, and every updates are linked at the bottom of the posts. Take your time with it.Knowing and understanding this is crucial, as it provides the market with contextâ€”revealing precisely what investors (not speculators) are pricing in, and thus essentially supplying a framework for interpreting the momentum of market movements and macro trends. This was particularly important in March, when we began to see the market react unusually sensitively to Trumpâ€™s statements. And without this context, Trumpâ€™s actions and the marketâ€™s reactions would have been completely meaninglessâ€”leaving many, who donâ€™t understand or donâ€™t know about this plan, literally scratching their heads in confusion.THE US - RUSSIA - MIDDLE-EAST ALLIANCE AND THE MARKETIn short, the essence of the plan was to forge a new economic and military alliance between the United States, Russia, and the Middle Eastâ€”and it would benefit all three and their partners. On one hand, it would provide genuine geopolitical security and keep the world open. On the other, sharing technology and economic resources would deliver stable growth and rising prosperity for everyone involved. (See details in the dedicated post)We must recognize that the two superpowers competing today are the United States and Chinaâ€”and that the real battleground for leverage lies in winning over Russia and the regionâ€™s sovereign wealth funds. China has already cultivated a close relationship with Russiaâ€”first because the West shut Russia out, and second because through Putin it gained a bridge to the Arabs, who together control over 42 % of global wealth. Those Russian and Arab interests are straightforward: they seek reliable, stable investments. That Sino-Russian connection deepened in 2019 when President Trump first opened to rapprochement with Russia. The key here is diplomatic cooperation, not an isolated militarism. A U.S.-Russia alliance would also be ideologically more durable than any China-Russia ententeâ€”since Putin deliberately transformed post-Communist Russia (extreme left) into a nationalist state grounded in Orthodox Christianity (extreme right), so as to share deeper cultural roots with the West. And Trump, observing Americaâ€™s excesses of liberalismâ€”which ultimately leads to collapse in both social and economic termsâ€”has steered the U.S. toward a right-leaning mindset, a mirror of a broader global trend. The right naturally aligns with the right, the left with the left. This is crucial.But Russia and the Gulf investors imposed two conditions on the alliance:1) stagflation must be purged from the US economyâ€”even if only on paper. This is vital, because stagflation is a time bomb. Everyone knows that only drastic demand cuts and a deliberate boost to supply can defeat stagflationâ€”and that process brings deflation (not necessarily a spiral, but deflation nonetheless). Itâ€™s extremely unstable, and not a place where billionaires want to park capital; they need to see solid conditions, because they will invest only once itâ€™s clear America can deliver stable, genuine, sustainable growth. This is critical.2) Putinâ€™s full ceasefire terms must be accepted. In essence, those restore conditions to the pre-Paris-1997 status quo, creating a buffer zone where no NATO forces are deployed on Russian soil. What does this mean for Ukraine? To understand that, recall that in 2014 the Crimean peninsula voted to secedeâ€”an initiative Russia supported, since Crimea is predominantly ethnic Russian and its ports remained vital to Moscow. Ukraine neither consented nor went to war over Crimeaâ€™s annexation; partisan actions occurred, but no full-scale conflict. Then Ukraineâ€™s military doctrine changed to make reclaiming Crimea by force a priority. The UK, EU, and the Democratic U.S. government pledged support to President Zelenskiy and pushed to admit Ukraine into NATO. Putinâ€™s red line was clear: no country embroiled in a military conflict could join NATO, per Article 10 of the Washington Treaty. If Ukraine became a member and resumed operations to retake Crimea, NATOâ€™s Article 5 would trigger a clash with the CSTOâ€”and thus World War III. Those facts were well understood in Brussels, London, and Washington, and they gambled that Putin might back down. Instead, Russia moved to secure additional territories, ensuring Ukraine could never qualify for NATO membership. Putin himself spelled out that rationale. From then on, each action prompted a reaction.I must emphasize that no one truly knows the truth; but Russia holds the power: anyone who seeks peace must accept Russiaâ€™s position. Yes, Russian diplomats also tend to employ their own â€œnuancesâ€ and persuasive framing (so are europeans)â€¦but that is how diplomacy works. Thereâ€™s no moral high ground on either side. Both are dirty. Both are equally responsible. Why? Because each has its own arguments to justify its actions. And thatâ€™s the key. Thatâ€™s the most important thing. (According to my personal belief, every one of them will answer to God for this, and I leave that to Him.)From a diplomatic perspective, what matters is the risk/reward ratio. Go to war with Russia? Possible, but the risk far outweighs the reward. Negotiate and let go of some moral principles? Well, thatâ€™s still not a positive reward either, but the risk is much smaller, so itâ€™s a more favorable ratio. Thatâ€™s all that counts here, nothing else. And this is sadâ€¦To analyze their position, you must think with their mindsetâ€”and personal moral judgments have no place here.From the Russian envoys involved in the peace talks, I was told that Putin does not actually wish to annex more territory. They envision partitioning Ukraine along â€œKorean Peninsulaâ€ lines; Putin fundamentally wants a diplomatic resolutionâ€”a path that the EU has so far refused to consider.Letâ€™s think for a moment at the level of principlesâ€¦ if we choose to handle the two problems separately, each will inevitably spawn further problems. Thatâ€™s why we need to find a single tool that advances both causes. And that tool is the â€¦**drum roll**â€¦ tariffsTARIFFS (the main idea behind them) If you recall 2024, when I wrote about Trumpâ€™s comeback and its significanceâ€”and then, by mid-summer, it had become a very popular topicâ€”everyone knew exactly what his plans were for immigrants, that he wanted a weak dollar, higher tariffs, and to isolate America to some degree: to turn more introvert rather than babysit everyone else. Thatâ€™s typically right-wing, nationalist thinking. The market priced that in. So how could his tariff policy almost trigger a Western crisis?It happened because the context changed and the tariff levels became too high and surprising for those who didnâ€™t know about the underlying plan. Investors and traders didnâ€™t understand exactly what was happening, but they understood what it could cause: the unraveling of the U.S. federal system, the strengthening of BRICS, a Chinese counterattack via bond sales, a drastic economic contraction, a deflationary spiral, a â€˜California vs. Texasâ€™ U.S. civil war, and military conflicts around the world as U.S. hegemony weakened. I wrote several analyses on these risks.This creates very high inconfidence among investorsâ€¦Yet the true purpose of the tariffs was to force the European Union to the negotiating tableâ€”and thus compel them to agree to a ceasefireâ€”simply because the EU is essentially supported and protected by the U.S. Moreover, a wave of selling triggers a market crash, creating a negative-wealth effect. The CEOs of BlackRock, JPMorgan and other big banks and funds assured the government that they got every tool to prevent a deflationary spiral. And once the risk subsided, the Arabs and Russians would buy into U.S. markets again, sparking a long-term upswing.At the same time, high tariffs could also bring other countries to the table to reshape global relationships. This served as a filter to expose BRICSâ€™s weaknesses. Although China then proposed talks, they also bristled at the challenge.The problem was that the EU, because of its left-wing ideology, turned to far-left China for helpâ€”as I had predictedâ€”to fill the financing role the U.S. had played for them. China was ready. That undercut Trump: the tariffsâ€™ impact diminished and the EU refused to negotiate. So, after careful calculation, tariffs were raised again against China to force them to the table. The aim was to expose Chinaâ€™s weaknesses, deter them from supporting the EU, and prevent BRICS from becoming too powerful. This was what I called the â€œU.S.-China poker gameâ€.Chinaâ€™s weakness was evident, but the U.S. had way much more to loseâ€”and thatâ€™s the key. Thatâ€™s what Xi was speculating on: time.Investors didnâ€™t trust Trumpâ€™s ability to navigate this through. They saw that China was holding firm, preparing for a protracted conflict, threatening Taiwan, and that Americaâ€™s former allies were drifting toward BRICS, and steadly losing leverage. It was an extremely unstable situation. They also knew that tariffs ultimately stoke more inflation (fueling stagflation), and they saw that Trump currently lacked the leverage to force the EU into a ceasefire.Faced with this instability, investors pulled their money out. Seeing the U.S. economy teeter on the edge of a deflationary spiral, Washington slowly activated its support mechanisms.However in itself it is not enough for the investorsâ€”no real progress was made. Any bad newsâ€”further escalation, new Chinese tariffs, a blockade of Taiwanâ€”would trigger another sell-off and a fresh low.China then enacted monetary easing. In this context, that was clearly a sign of weakness under the hood (for those who saw the underlying context). In the eurozone, stagflation risk emerged. And this was the point, where investor uncertainty began to ease: they stopped massive selling, though they still werenâ€™t buying.Then, in the latest developmentsâ€”namely, the successful Putin/Witkoff talksâ€”investor sentiment began to shift.Inside China, domestic discontent is rising, and economic weakness is surfacing. Their denial of having any talks on with the U.S. is a severe diplomatic and trust blow. This could soon restore U.S. leverage. A few European politicians have already signaled their willingness to negotiate. Trump plans to speak with them after the Popeâ€™s funeral. So by Sunday weâ€™ll know more. All signs, however, point to Trumpâ€™s policy having finally stepped onto the path that leads out of the woods.For investors, this shift signals that U.S. dignity and strength have passed the test. Therefore, no further withdrawals (no â€œlower lowsâ€) should be expectedâ€”unless some positive progression reverses. The odds of that arenâ€™t high, but theyâ€™re significantly above zero. And that matters. Do you get the idea? Okay. â€˜cuz there are moreâ€¦WHATS THE PROBLEM?Let me tell you whatâ€™s wrong. On one hand, the fact that China is denying any dialogue with the U.S. (despite their own press releases) shows that they intend to keep the tariff war going. Remember, itâ€™s not in Chinaâ€™s interest to let the U.S. achieve its goals. Chinaâ€™s weapon is simply time here. The question is whether Xi has correctly judged that Chinaâ€™s moment has arrived or not. Who folds firstâ€¦? Still no one has foldedâ€”only the odds have shifted, and dramatically so.If China does continue the tariff war, that could be a major turning point. Because if they donâ€™t cut off EU supportâ€”and the ties between China and the EU grow tighterâ€”the EU could still back away from the ceasefire. Let me note here that the EU still hasnâ€™t formally agreed to the truce. It only appears they may soon be willing to sit down with the U.S. Donâ€™t forgetâ€¦But if that bond deepens and they see U.S. being in trouble and stepping back from the peace negotiations as they promised in London, Taiwan and the First Island Chain still loom as threats. Trump knows this, and so do investors.So the problem remains that, even though U.S. superiority is clear, risks from China still persist. China didnâ€™t fold, the EU didnâ€™t accept the truce, and one moreâ€¦ **drum roll**â€¦our dear friend Jerome Powell still doesnâ€™t see rate cuts as appropriate. As Iâ€™ve been saying since March, weâ€™re expecting the first cut in June. Thatâ€™s crucial, because the market needs monetary support to see a stable rally. If that happens, weâ€™ll get a truly parabolic squeezeâ€”followed by a mean reversion.tl;dr the market needs two things for a true bottom: China must fold (which then forces a USâ€“EU truce), and the Fed must embark on sustainable QEâ€”before youâ€™ll see lasting confirmation. None of them actually happened, only the odds have shifted todayâ€¦HOW ABOUT THE MARKET?As I mentioned above, you have to understand that in most cases the market is driven by supply and demand, quarterly positioning, and the associated structural flows. However, in the current state the market and the economy have become fundamentally unstable, and policymakers are working to stabilize them. We are literally on the left tailâ€”as I keep emphasizingâ€”in the low-probability extremes of the distribution.This environment demands rapid adaptation and a precise mapping of the fundamental forces that define market trends.Remember that before the market even started to fall, I said the target was last Aprilâ€™s low. For now, that remains the bottom. If the progressions continue and real acts happen, then bottom confirmed and I go net long. Until then, the risk that the market drops below that levelâ€”or that it simply retests and fills the four gaps belowâ€”is significant.Letâ€™s think like investors.The market needs liquidity in order to functionate more efficiently not hyper-sensitively. That liquidity is provided back by the dealers and the ever-more confident day-traders.

In this article, I will introduce you to methods based on the modern mathematical findings of mean reversion strategy research, which are applied by funds that rely on high-level quant strategies.I will address each of these methods individually in the future.MODERN TIMES The foundation of quantitative trading lies in searching for market inefficiencies and leveraging the resulting opportunities for excess return (alpha). If you recall, the strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis states that prices always reflect all available information, implying no predictable patterns (such as mean reversion) should persist. However, real-world observations contradict this. Why? Well, in my view, it fundamentally comes down to the aggregation of numerous stochastic processes.

# Monthly outlook into Aug - Sept window + Weekly post (04/Aug - 08/Aug)

Market analysisMonthly outlook into Aug - Sept window + Weekly post (04/Aug - 08/Aug)Aug/Sept window overview, Oil, Gold, Silver, BTC, SPXAug 03, 2025âˆ™ Paid3724ShareA quick overview:SubscribeThis Aug-Sept window is pivotal for the US markets and economy as I keep saying since April.The problem is geo againâ€¦Trump finally recognized that he was sitting in a boiling water set by his political opponents in the US, and he is now in panic mode. He got everything he needed at the start, to build longterm alliances, but he got successfully trapped into a psychological reflexive control, as he is too impatient and pride. Geopolitical miscalculations and mistakes are possible to start to occure into/during the August OpEx week, that irreversibly destroy everything that is built til now. (This will also favor Musk to to riseâ€¦)Btw, I want to tell you one thing hereâ€¦ the timing of the tariffs are not as random as many thinksâ€¦ one of my friend talked with me about Trump being extremely relied on astrology (most leaders are, btw). He told me, that according to Vedic astrology, from the second half of July, the western economy stepped into some specific planteray transits that can be read as windows for famine, financial instability, and holds until the end of November. This sets a favorable environment for any tariff-attacks for someone who believes in astro, these conditions may amplify the tariff effects on the opponents.Also his impatience is amplified because astrologically Trump will faces health, legal and political karmic challeneges going into September, with potential inner conflicts in the US. So, it is logical that he is trying to achieve as much as he can, and the prophecy can fulfill itselfâ€¦ Not a coincidence that Jim Simons also monitored closely the astrology because, many leaders rely on them, and also used as encrypted codes between funds and insider entities. This is why some researchers found fluctuating but significant correlation between lunar cycles and market cycles. The oil is expected to rise towards $80 and I speculate on further rise towards its 2022â€™s highs in the following months, as a result of tariffs. As you know, Iâ€™m bullish on gold and silver on the long-run, so is on bitcoin - not speculating on short-term noises here. No edge on that. I expect further geopolitical turmoils into the OpEx week on equities with further risk-off and sell. Then from the second half into Sept OpEx, I expect short-term rebound and a potential bulltrap to be built.

# Monthly update, Inflation + Weekly post (21-25/July)

Market analysisMonthly update, Inflation + Weekly post (21-25/July)Jul 20, 2025âˆ™ Paid2625ShareANNOUNCEMENTI wonâ€™t work between July 24 and Aug 1, I will create one chat room for that period, and I will be here on FOMC day, but there will be no intraday posts in that period. In Friday post, I wrote macro: The momentum is bullish for now, profits getting taken, volume is low, and liquidity is unstable. All what you see is mechanical flows and short-term speculative tradings and short squeezes. And Iâ€™m pretty sure that this trend will hold until FOMC, that is my main risk target since May. This is why I keep emphatizing since June 24, that donâ€™t rush to short this market yet.But market needs Powell to comfirm it. If no Fed cut, no yield relief = no cash out of MMFs, meaning no liquidity boost for equities. Market support from shortâ€‘term liquidity evaporates, causing a significant unwind of the current, liquidityâ€‘driven rally. Simply because the liquidity lifeline stays locked into MMFs and Tâ€‘bills. Lower frontâ€‘end yields have been a key catalyst for equity rallies. And this is what the Fed can control, the long-end is owned by the investors. So, as Treasury issuance outstrips MMF absorption capacity, yields will spike, liquidity will decline, and this fake growth rally will unravel.The thing is that since the 2000s the M2 went from 4.7 trln to 21.94 trln USD, while total market value from 13.45 trln to 62.2 trln USD. So it means that excess liquidity has been the primary driver of soaring stock valuations, rather than proportional growth in real economic output.I strongly think that when equities start to fall, BTC will go with them as well, the way it did in April:Money goes from risk assets to safe-havens, then allocate a portion of it into digital assets and some back to legacy markets. And so on. Deposits must be washed slowly out and market needs new home.

Educational postsMy basic trading principles Pt. 1 - Strategies, basic risk managementJul 02, 2025âˆ™ Paid5934ShareIn this post I will examine the psychological aspects of trading. Iâ€™ll briefly illustrateâ€”through my own experienceâ€”the essence of technical analysis and position analysis, explain how working people can easily determine the amount they can allocate to trading, and share my core practical principles for directional trading. SubscribeTECHNICAL ANALYSIS OR POSITIONING ANALYSIS? My personal journey on analysisThis is a very old and unnecessary debate between the two camps about which approach is more valuable. I call it â€œunnecessaryâ€ because it doesnâ€™t matter which one you use, as long as you understand the outputs. In short: technical analysis â€œguessesâ€ the important liquidity zones and probabilities based on historical data, while quantitatively monitoring positioning data, explaining the meaning behind levels and market environments, and thus gives us much greater confidence in determining probability distributions.So, the micro-cycles are determined by the volatility market, within which technical analysis applies. The volatility market helps establish the probability distribution with a high conviction level, but which trades I close and which I size up is ultimately dictated by the realized chart patterns. Fundamentals, by contrast, merely serve to supply a made-up narrative for the prevailing market dynamics. Thatâ€™s why I never factor the fundamental itself purely into my calculations; instead, I focus on timing and ask myself, â€œWhat story are they trying to sell me?â€â€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Educational postsMy trading principles Pt. 2 - The Wall Street Casino and My StoryTurning negative edge into positive edgeSep 20, 2025âˆ™ Paid2871ShareThe marketâ€™s system is structured so that most trading strategies are sure to be loss-making in the long run. This is similar to a casino, except that the negative edge comes together in a much more complex way. What are the components of this negative edge? What can we do to achieve a positive edge? What strategies exist for long-term positive returns? And what is the difference between a speculator and an investor? These are what Iâ€™m going to write about. SubscribeFirst, Iâ€™d like to revisit the importance of expected value, long-term edge, and risk management. A trader does not typically remain unprofitable primarily because of a low directional accuracy rate. Data show that retail activity often anticipates short-term market momentum; yet, broker risk disclosures consistently report that more than 80% of retail accounts in average lose money. The core issues are the lack of a consistent strategy and discipline, and poor position sizing. That is what I will address now.

Market analysisNear-term outlook, Free-education about principles, Risk window - Intraday post (13/08)Furu mentality vs Advanced mentalityAug 13, 2025âˆ™ Paid161ShareFor longer-term planningI still cautious with long-term positions because I want to see how the admin and US handles the tariff effects. For now, the core CPI doesnâ€™t show disinflation at all, the opposite: sticky pressures, but market is up on the adminâ€™s communication. Before sizing down the hedges I want to see PPI to confirm or disprove any trend, and to wait for Jackson Hole next week. As said yesterday, a print like this extends the risk window into Jackson Hole, but Iâ€™m overall bullish into September. (Basically imagine the chart I showed here, but instead of OpEx date, it is pushed forwards by a week, and downside target is 6095/6035)The Sept rate cut event will be interesting. If it happens, it can cause a melt up into 7k, but soon after the SPX will revert, simply because market knows that inflation is going up, and market should be up on economic performance not on speculative, mechanical buying flows. And future high inflation is actually bad for firms, industries, corporations. However, I donâ€™t expect bear-marketish trend, only a repricing/reversion/buy-the-dip event. As you know, I overall bullish on a yearly term:Playing the AI-Bubble; Long-term outlook AlmaÂ·July 22, 2025Read full storyThe OpEx flows are still very supportive, downside volatility is well supplied, meaning, mechanically liquidity is generated there. Market outperformed the levels I gave in the weekly post, meaning the melt-up tendency is being confirmed. However, technically it is only a breakout, a strong one, but you need to see confirmation during this session, before decide to size up, or down on that. The breadth expanded well, and weekly vacuum-up is started as SPX has entered the â€œright-tailâ€ range:With increased spot/vol beta:My target volatility level is 13.59% (currently the RV is at 10.16%), that would produce a melt-up towards 6570 SPX in the following week and 6600 into month-end. Interesting enough, these calculations pretty much align with a bigger channel targets: The reversion probability is at 88.36%, but I want to see 90/91% in order to have a high conviction mean reversion call. My risk window is not over yetâ€¦SubscribeNow, listen very-very-very carefullyâ€¦Portfolio management, Mindset, DisclaimerI want to take this opportunity to explain that what Iâ€™m writing about isnâ€™t about trying to guess where the market will go now. This is something I keep explaining to my subs since Iâ€™ve opened this Substack, but I still see a lot of misunderstanding about trading. The market is going up regardlessâ€”that isnâ€™t in dispute. As you know, I expect a 65â€“72% rise during a Trump presidency, provided there is a rate cut and a ceasefire in Ukraine holds. The goal is to determine the near-term risk.My long-term portfolio makes up roughly 75% of my total managed wealth. Most of it is in domestic bonds and precious metals, and about one-third in equities and cryptoassets. I use around further 15% for swing and day trading (at max!), and keep roughly 10% in cash for emergency. These are rough estimates, but I try to maintain this weighting when I take profits. For me, trading is a supplemental source of income that I donâ€™t use every dayâ€”only when I see good (high probability) opportunities. Most of my management is the continual rebalancing of the long-term portfolio. By that I mean I assess risks and set target levels at which I increase the weight of certain hedges relative to the underlying long exposureâ€”and then do the reverse once risk has proved to be declined. The goal is wealth-building, not gambling. Trading is merely a way to create new capital that I can put into further investments. This overemphasis on day trading is a harmful mindset, driven by advertising and social-media hype. A lot of people are obsessed with having the highest possible hit rate. Most intraday moves are not reliably predictable. Sometimes they are, but more often not. What matters are levels that actually mean something. A trader should plan position sizing, define a max loss per trade, and decide in advance where to close or where to scale up. The hit rate isnâ€™t what matters, risk management is. I wrote a whole educational post about it. If your hit rate is only 35%, that means 65 losing trades out of 100. Suppose you lose exactly 10 pts on each losing trade (your max loss). Thatâ€™s 650 points down. On the remaining 35 winners, you need to make only 19 points each to end up +15 points after the 100th trade. In practice you wonâ€™t always lose exactly 10 (thatâ€™s your max loss-limit here), and you wonâ€™t always win only 19 pts because you scale up your winners. The point stands: strategy matters more than hit rate.The current trend is very fast and aggressive, yet illiquid. Illiquid trends are prone to tail events (in this case, a â€œvacuum-upâ€ effect), but they donâ€™t build a durable, long-term structure. Everybody feels and meassures the lack of stability in this rally. Building long-term positions into this trend is risky.My personal decision for now is to give up some slope in my long-term portfolio growth (because increased hedging may expire worthless) until I see a 5â€“6% correction. My present risk window is the PPI release and the Jackson Hole symposium. Reasons are explained. I want to see how the U.S. economy/policy handles the inflationary impact of tariffs. Either we get the correction here, orâ€”if the communication is benignâ€”the next risk window is the September FOMC, because after a rate cut the market will have to reprice itself. If there is a cut, it would be a hawkish cut. By then the SPX could reach 6600â€”or even 7000. Iâ€™ll detail this in the next weekend post. The key point is that the market is so heavily manipulated right now that itâ€™s hard to state anything with high confidence. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m waiting for roughly a 90% mean-reversion probability signal, which Iâ€™ll likely only get above 6500. In the meantime, I have my open bullish positions running since last week, hedged short-term with inexpensive OTM spreads with end-August and end-September expos. Iâ€™ll only increase their weight if spot breaks a few key price levels. This is something I keep telling since mid-July.Iâ€™ve provided some groundwork for these calculations in my educational postsâ€”and will add moreâ€”because I increasingly see that most people arenâ€™t actually managing a portfolio, theyâ€™re treating trading like a shooting range*. *By this what I mean is that some people keep trying to trade the market in advanceâ€”without any planning or risk managementâ€”before any momentum is actually confirmed. I place my trades based on probabilities, and I only reweight them once something has been validated. I emphasize this every day, and in February and March I even demonstrated it with live trading. I also pointed to books on probability-based betting strategies that explain how to achieve long-term growth in a highly stochastic system. But sometimes it feels like Iâ€™m talking to a brick wall. People keep just shooting blindly.

Very important piece.Weekly upside target was hit with reversion back to the expected price levels into Thursday, where I said â€œprofit taking will occurâ€. Today is NFP day The sentiment is â€œbad news are good newsâ€. Hiring was weaker than expected, but not collapsing. The unemployment rate fell, and wages stayed firm, producing a mixed (not dovishâ€‘clean) signal.Job creation remains concentrated in lowerâ€‘cyclicality, lowerâ€‘wage services, while consumerâ€‘sensitive sectors (retail) are contracting. This is consistent with a lateâ€‘cycle / costâ€‘controlled labor market.The labor market is not tight in a healthy way; it is stable because hiring is low and firing is low, not because demand for labor is strong.Job growth needed to keep unemployment stable is estimated at ~50kâ€“120k, meaning this print is near maintenance, a structurally slower labor market due to demographics and immigration, not recessionary. So we can expect Fed holds nearâ€‘term rather than rushes to cut. CPI, PPI and OpEx next weekâ€¦As said in the weekly post, optimism is not expected to change. SCOTUSTrump and his team have a â€˜Plan Bâ€™ if SCOTUS strikes down the IEEPA-based tariffs, like pivot to other trade statutesâ€”for example: Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.  Meanwhile, importers are preparing for a refund battle, with potential refunds as Customs will begin electronic duty refunds in Feb. And some companies have even filed preemptive lawsuits to preserve refund rights, and a secondary market has emerged where some importers are selling refund claims to hedge funds at steep discounts. Even if tariffs are invalidated, the cleanup could take months or years due to complications like documentation issues, liquidation deadlines, and possible litigation.  Bessent said that the bigger risk of an adverse ruling is losing speed and negotiating flexibility (customs revenues are now roughly $30B/month), not losing tariff revenue outright, because other legal authorities still exist  So, this will be likely a long, back-and-forth chess match, not a one-day headline.  Heavy rotation, a range-bound tape, and rising uncertainty into spring is ahead...Market expects more of this event than what its actual impact will be now.

The preliminary revision first announced each late-summer vs. the final revision that gets baked into the data the following February. In August, the unemployment rate went up by 4.3%, NFP increased only by 22k. What this data suggest is that job growth reached a pivot in May since COVID crisis. This is a big red-flag, and will have longer-term consequences. The next 3-5 year will lead to a global crisis for the western world before stockmarket will be integrated to Web3 (reason is explained in the â€œPlaying the AI-Bubbleâ€ post). SubscribeSo today the 2025 preliminary benchmark revision is publiced, and market expects a large downward preliminary revision. This would smean, that growth was weaker than first reported over Apr-2024 to Mar-2025. However, as you can see, the final revision (Feb 2026) is usually revised a bit higher. Anyways, itâ€™d say labor market had already cooled more than the monthly CES prints showed. But market doesnâ€™t expect negative growth, just slowed positive growth. And according to the market it would be a good news because it provides further opportunity for a hawkish â€œinsurance cutâ€. They would not be happy about it, but it provides further occassion to buy the dip until the cut happens.

# NFP, Stagflation, Deflation, Intraday post (04/April)

> A very important shift in sentiment is on the way!

**Date:** unknown
**Source:** https://stochvoltrader.substack.com/p/nfp-stagflation-deflation-intraday

Market analysisNFP, Stagflation, Deflation, Intraday post (04/April)A very important shift in sentiment is on the way!Apr 04, 2025âˆ™ Paid2435ShareNon-Farm Payrolls measures the net change in employment (excluding farm workers, private household employees, and non-profit organization employees). Change: Robust NFP numbers signal a strong economy, whereas significantly lower numbers indicate a cooling job market, as the overall economic demand is weak, due to declining consumer spending and uncertainty about future growth, and businesses are either hesitant to expand or are even cutting back on hiring. As job creation slows or reverses, fewer workers find new employment opportunities. Those laid off or entering the market add to the unemployment rate. With fewer people employed, aggregate consumer income and spending fall, causing the economic slowdown. When inflation is driven by supply shocks rather than demand pressures (like in 2020), unemployment can rise even as prices continue to climb. Once inflation expectations become unanchored, the economy can fall into a self-reinforcing cycle: weak NFP leads to rising unemployment, which suppresses demand further, while cost pressures maintain or even drive up inflation. Simply because prices react to supply/demand ratio. But it does matter which one is rising relative to the other.  Central banks face a conundrum: tightening monetary policy to combat inflation can further suppress growth and worsen unemployment. Conversely, loosening policy to boost employment risks fueling inflation even more. This is stagflation.My call is to get a stagflationary print. That would show very low/stagnant growth or even a contraction in some sectors. Along with weak job gains, unemployment might start to creep upward or fail to decline, indicating slack in the labor market. Although wages might be rising in nominal terms, real wage growth would be subdued once inflation is taken into account. Persistent high inflation in the face of sluggish job growth confirms that demand isnâ€™t driving robust employment gains.Now let me show you something very importantâ€¦ Something is lurkingâ€¦ Yields show that market participants are hedging downside risks and slowing economic growth. (Donâ€™t forget that the 10-year yield is a benchmark for many interest rates, including mortgages and corporate bonds. A drop means itâ€™s now cheaper for borrowers to raise funds.)Equities are down as we know by 4.84% while VIX is up by only 3.06%, with steepening backwardation: This is simply due to the complacency Iâ€™m talking about, while insiders are trying their best to avoid vol squeeze. But look at this: Gold futures are also down, lower than 3%, but itâ€™s there. It can be nothing for now, but if the trend continous, it can signal that gold becomes less attractive, since it does not generate yield. If investors shift toward holding cash or highly liquid bonds over gold, that foreshadows expactations of increase the real value of cash. Listenâ€¦When aggregate demand (consumer spending, business investment, government expenditure, and net exports) falls, prices tend to drop. Reduced spending leads to lower production, which in turn can trigger layoffs and further declines in demand. A reduction in the money supplyâ€”whether due to tight monetary policy or banking crisesâ€”reduces the amount of money chasing goods and services. (This was a central feature of the Great Depression.) This also increases the real value of debt (the debt burden does not decline with falling prices), both households and companies find it harder to service their obligations. And as real debt burdens increase, this worsens the balance sheets of borrowers and can lead to a cycle of reduced spending and further price declines.. Nominal wages donâ€™t adjust downward easily due to contracts and worker resistance. This creates a disconnect where real wages rise, further exacerbating unemployment as firms try to cut costs.This process is called: deflation. This can result in a feedback loop, when 1) reduced spending leads to lower sales and profits, prompting companies to cut costs and lay off workers; 2) with more people out of work, incomes fall, which further depresses consumer spending; 3) lower demand drives prices down even further. As prices drop, the real burden of debt increases, causing financial stress; 4) This increased debt burden and reduced income prompt even less spending and investment, which causes prices to fall furtherâ€”thus deepening the deflation. We are not there at all. We are in stagflation, where the economy growing slowly or stagnating, and prices remain high because of supply shocks.In a stagnant economy, borrowers face high real debt burdens. As Irving Fisherâ€™s debt-deflation theory explains, falling output can worsen the real value of debt, squeezing spending further. If consumer and business confidence deteriorates further, due to persistent weak growth and the burden of high debt, spending can drop dramatically. This decline in demand can eventually overpower the supply-side pressures that were keeping prices high. Once people and firms begin to expect that prices will continue to fall, they delay purchases. This behavior can trigger a deflationary environment even a spiral. See Japanâ€™s â€œlost decadesâ€.I donâ€™ believe that this gonna happen and it doesnâ€™t even need, listenâ€¦ if this trend continues, it means investor sentiment is beginning to price in the risk of deflation. That would be a very important shift!But if you understood my post about geopolitics and the global economy, youâ€™ll get that this is precisely the goal! Trump isnâ€™t trying to lure retail traders onto the wrong side; heâ€™s targeting institutional investors. He is fighting the sentiment. He isnâ€™t trying to curb monthly near-term inflation, but rather flush stagflation out of the market completelyâ€”much as Volcker did back in the day. The difference is that now thereâ€™s the unregulated derivatives market, and you have major banks, investment funds, and in the future, Arab and Jewish investors to save the market and the economy and â€œbuy the dipâ€.And from now on, all indicators and trends should be interpreted in the light of this.

# NFP, Trump-Musk feud, Scheme, Rangebound + Intraday post (06/June)

Market analysisNFP, Trump-Musk feud, Scheme, Rangebound + Intraday post (06/June)Jun 06, 2025âˆ™ Paid142ShareSubscribeFed minutes at their May meeting warned of â€œrisks that inflation could prove more persistent than expected and that unemployment could riseâ€.NFP is today. A weakerâ€thanâ€expected NFP reading signals a slowing labor market and broadening economic softening. If job gains decline materially, it suggests firms are hiring less, which raises recession risks. If NFP shows job gains < 125k, recession risk is up sharply. SPX/LTY beta is negative in both window. Slower growth is interpreted as making Fed easing more likely. That pushes bond yields down and stocks upâ€”reinforcing the negative beta (â€œgood news are bad newsâ€). Not a big euphoric happiness tho, but moderate reaction. CPI next week is pivotal along with NFP. Always wait for the volatility to settle before take any trades on data release days. Never rush, and never trade without a conception! Trump - Musk feud and its implicationsIn short, Trump publicly labeled Musk â€œcrazyâ€ and threatened to cut off Muskâ€™s SpaceX/Starlink contracts; Musk fired back, forecasting a recession from Trumpâ€™s tariffs. Yesterdayâ€™s TSLA drop triggered VIX gamma squeeze, and dragged NDX and SPX down due to its weight. If 25â€“50 % tariffs on China/EU imports starting July 9, 2025 would pass, that would cause escalation, TSLA would sell off and drag broader indices downâ€”re-amplifying volatility.The main implication is that the recent supportive Trump flow bailed the market out (tariff threats â†’ volatility spike â†’ Trump retreats â†’ equities rebound) is now gone with the feud. What does it imply? Well, even tho I see a bit lower odds of a crash, a controlled pullback (up to â€“20% in a recession scenario) remains possible if NFP disappoints and CPI stays elevated. Trump wonâ€™t be that willing to reverse tariffs as quickly as before.Tariffs announced in early April 2025 will fully filter through to consumer prices by Julyâ€“August 2025, adding roughly 0.2 pp to core PCE over that period. Businesses will exhaust preâ€tariff inventories and begin passing higher import costs onto endâ€prices. I see repositioning into July-August window. Despite aggressive vol selling into June, traders are increasingly concerned of a vol squeeze for that period (similar to 2018 Oct). Then higher odds for another 25 bp cut in Sept.Momentum tradingFor now, market proved ranging. Market is scalped by momentum trading algos and vol market. But NFP and CPI matter. Key levels are: SPX : 5915.27; 5813.79 SPY : 590.38; 580.26ES=F : 5929.80; 5829.49 NDX : 21,385.39; 20,940.04NQ : 21,459.09; 21,015.30VIX : 19.02; 22.70Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Yesterday I posted this: The reason is the even more uncertainity that was injected into the economy and the markets by not releasing Autumn datas, letting Fed to fly blindly. The lie about inflation and the real state of the economy is obvious now, market doesnâ€™t know what to price in, it is in the darkness, while tech sector (GPU) is being hit. Very crucial!The structure is unstable, downside is supplied with liquidity (thats where the distribution wants to shift the spot), and market is not prepared to any bad news. Why?

# NVDA ER, GDP, PCE, Valuation - Intraday post (27/Aug)

Market analysisNVDA ER, GDP, PCE, Valuation - Intraday post (27/Aug)ExpectationsAug 27, 2025âˆ™ Paid8ShareMarket is waiting for NVDA ER, GDP and PCEâ€¦ Weekly post: Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)AlmaÂ·August 24, 2025Last week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.Read full storyThe NVDA expectations are about $46 billion in revenue and roughly $1.00â€“$1.02 per share in adjusted EPS. It is expected to beat both top-line and bottom-line expectations and to guide Q3 revenue in the lowâ€“$50s billion range, because of the surging demand for Nvidiaâ€™s AIâ€‘focused dataâ€‘centre GPUs, which accounted for about $39 billion of the companyâ€™s $44 billion revenue last quarter, and strong orders from hyperscalers and enterprise customers.NVDA is priced rich, it is trading around 55Ã— trailing earnings and about 10 Ã— sales. The PEG ratio is close to 0.7, which indicates that the current price-to-earnings multiple is only justified if the growth trajectory remains unbroken.The risk investors are watching is the impact of U.S. export restrictions on highâ€‘end AI chips to China (which Nvidia estimated could lower Q2 revenue by up to $8 billion), and the sustainability of supply-chain capacity for new â€œBlackwellâ€ and â€œRubinâ€ chips, and whether cloud providersâ€™ capitalâ€‘expenditure plans will continue to rise. Any indication that demand is moderating or that margins are under pressure could trigger a meaningful correction because the stock leaves little room for error. In my view, NVDA is trading at its intrinsic value range ($170-200 range) pricing in very high growth, but if GDP is bad, this growth this pricing will become overoptimistic. For me the current valuation offers a slim margin of safety, so I want to see a pullback before buying again. Reversion probability is about 86.90% with target of 171.20GDPThe real GDP is expected to grow at at an annualized 3.0% in Q2 2025 with minimal revision (consensus looks for no change, or only a slight moderation).This is supported by stronger personal consumption and a sharp decline in imports, which mechanically boosted GDP because imports are subtracted in the GDP formula.PCEJuly core PCE is estimated at +0.3% MoM, some estimate that it could even be a hair lower (~0.24â€“0.25%), expecting YoY core 2.8-3% PCE. Also note, if Lisa Cook can be fired, Trump gains full control over the Fed. Datas will then serve his interest and bubble would be start to get inflated hard.ValuationSPXâ€™ forward priceâ€‘toâ€‘earnings ratio is around 20-23x, while the 10â€‘year Treasury yield is around 4 %. This implies an earnings yield near 4 %â€”not far above bond yields. This means that stocks offer little margin for error.The current P/E would only be justified if longâ€‘term earnings growth were 5â€“6% higher than projected nominal GDP growth. So the market is pricing in a very rosy scenario for profits and productivity. Risk/reward is more balanced than in cheaper markets.

Educational postsOdds, Fair Bet and Kelly Criterion (position sizing)Moderate but necessary-math warning!Feb 01, 2025âˆ™ Paid3351ShareIn my previous posts, you encountered the concepts of "fair play" or "fair bet." In this post, Iâ€™m going to introduce this concept in more detail, as it is one of the fundamental principles of option pricing and a key concept in risk management. I will also introduce a bet sizing mathematical model known as the Kelly criterion.  When the expected value over 100 bets is exactly zero, we refer to it as a fair bet. This means that the growth curve has no trend, or in other words, over 100 bets, the PnL theoretically becomes zero for both parties. â€œNeither the seller nor the buyer has an edgeâ€ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

I didnâ€™t expected this low to be hit, but it wasâ€¦Vol selling failed above the centroid line of 6713.69, so intraday, the coin flipped towards bearishness. SubscribeAs market is approaching my WoR downside target, Iâ€™m not too bearish anymore, especially because we are approaching Fed, we have Thanksgiving next week, and admin is willing to intervene. Risk we have now is data, as I keep telling since the shutdown was said to be over. My bias is cautiously optimistic for the EOY, I expect consolidation into the first half of the next week, and risk appetite to rebuild after, but Fed should give the green light. My reversion model says 69% probability for a reversion with upside target of 7053.39 currently. So, it is not a time for me to be too bearish. Market is at pivot.A 5.98% pullback is not the end of the worldâ€¦ people are just too optimistic, not expecting bad news, as I kept warning, and get un-used to healthy 6-10% corrections after a 44.13% rallyâ€¦ (and this pullback is not even 6% yet!)But as I said, broadly, any rally from now is expected to be very fragile.The weakness is broad, investors are derisking cyclicals and financials. But the key is that its velocity is very high and sudden, market didnâ€™t take well the â€œend of shutdownâ€ info, as I said earlier, the trust has shaken. Hence cautious. Also we have multiple geo risks emerging along with policy misteps, economical miscalculations in terms of yields, inflation, AI, supply-chains, etc.For today, what I see on the volatility front:Traders might attempt to buy the dip, but I expect macro fears re-emerging again, and the prior confidence will be shaken.

Market analysisOpEx, Gaps, Downside risk, Bulls? - Intraday post (20/Nov)Nov 20, 2025âˆ™ Paid82ShareWindow of Risk update (free): Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update AlmaÂ·October 29, 2025Read full storyWeekly post: Sentiment has shaken - Weekly post (17-21/Nov)AlmaÂ·November 16, 2025Read full storyAlso dropped a quick review of the current momentum (free):[free] SPX, Gold, BTC - A quick overview of the recent momentum and sentimentAlmaÂ·November 18, 2025Read full storyIn yesterday premarket post I wrote: â€œIâ€™m not too bearish anymore, but also cautiously bullish, but wanna see these events unfold, if we get one more fast hit to the lowâ€¦â€ Now, all we should watch if the market accept these current levels or not. The positioning breakdown below will be telling what the market expects. Nvidia beat the expectations, but concerns are still there that the spending is unsustainable, but this is a long-term concern not an immediate one. The fact that â€œBlackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold outâ€ should be supportive for now.I cautiously think the Window of Risk is coming to an end now. First we got a 265.85 pts decline, then a 344.55 pts decline with higher lows. I want to see how market digests the news, plus we have OpEx and hedge unwind. I want to see how the market positions shift.SubscribeI tell you whyâ€¦The Nvida ER gave another fresh push to the AI bubble for now. And NFP is delayed again. This makes both the Fed and the market completely blindfolded, and also results in less macro-based trends and more micro-based mechanical movements, literal simulations. So with this step, admin solved the problem on the short-run to throw the macro effects out of the window. Breadth is very bearish, but this market is being built on AI narrative now, and the expectation is that automatic contributions, model portfolios and ETF rebalancing, market maker hedging flows keep pushing flows; and intraday trading is largely systematic anyway. Also SOFR is ~0.37 percentage points lower than the Oct 28 peak, it s still trading a bit above fed funds (~+6 bps on Nov 18), but the gap is smaller than the ~+15 bps around Oct 31. So, Short-term funding stress is easing, but system liquidity is still vulnerable. Not a green light, only a yellow one after red alert. We can assume that â€œtop is inâ€ for SOFR.So, the EOY rally will be driven on these, that I strongly think will come. Also I mentioned in the most recent free post linked above, that as long as the SPX doesnâ€™t show strenght in the 6791.68 - 6845.46 area, the pressure remains to the downside, reaching the downside target of my WoR.So be careful. Iâ€™m cautiously bullish, but market is not out of the woods yet, on the near-term!On the crypto frontâ€¦We will see if BTC gives us the rebound, I think it would along with the market.I donâ€™t buy BTC until it reaches my target, but then too I will be aware of some liquidity grab to 30-40k area.As you know, I never all-in on one position.SubscribeLetâ€™s scrutinize the daily positioningâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisOpEx + Intraday post (20/June)Jun 20, 2025âˆ™ Paid121ShareWeekly post - Vol of vol supply OpEx greeks dynamics The FOMC played out as expected. It unanimously voted to keep the federal funds rate at 4.25â€“4.50%, with the updated projections still showing a median of two rate cuts in 2025 despite higher inflation forecasts and geopolitical uncertainty around tariffs and the Middle East. Powellâ€™s post-meeting comments balanced reassurance on inflationâ€™s gradual cooling with caution over trade-driven price pressures, signaling the Fed remains data-dependent but in no hurry to ease further.Each $10 rise in oil (Hormuz threats) adds ~0.3 % to CPI, reviving stagflation fears. Geopolitical noise outweighs expectations of Fed easing. Only a significant disinflation in core CPI and wage growth would bring cuts as soon as Septemberâ€”otherwise, the Fed remains on hold into 2026. Of 19 policymakers, 8 forecast two 25 bp cuts in 2025, while 7 expect no cuts, making the median of two cuts a fragile compromise.

Statistically the first half of December is usually flat-to-negative in terms of performance, while the second half it steps into a steep positive phase. We can see problems in the economy and growing uncertainity about valuation in the tech sector, with rotation into value assets, but I donâ€™t expect it to have immediate impact. Mostly into late-Q1/Q2 next year with other policy shocks.Growth scare is off the table, as market is positive that the Fed will support the economy for any cost. More like they welcome slowdown as it gives more room for future stimulus and easing cycle, just as bonds and stocks tells; bad news is good news.Last week, on Friday the profit taking came one day later than I originally expected. But still market did not broke the structure. The only important thing, liquidity-wise is a gap below us at 6765.89 - 6783.87, that should be retested in order to provide more stability and confidence for an EoM rally. As long as this gap holds on the daily, the path of least resistance remains to the upside towards 7000 and even beyond. We have VIX expo, M&QOpEx, NFP and retail sales on Tuesday, and CPI on Thursday, plus BoJ rate decision that effects carry trade. Market expects in-line or cooler-than-expected for now, that they welcome. However, a BoJ rate will likely affect risk sentiment, but more like after the OpEx week, and I donâ€™t expect a too significant impact, as carry book isnâ€™t that large however if the tone is more hawkish than expected, it can cause some trouble (but less odds, as their growth is kinda ok).

Market analysisOpEx week, China risk - Weekly post (13 - 17/Oct)Oct 12, 2025âˆ™ Paid2411ShareExplaining my Window of Risk call:Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tellsAlmaÂ·September 18, 2025Read full storyIn my last weekly post, I expected Monday-Tuesday stability and grind-up with looming risk, and volatility risk into the second half of the week with downside target of 6514.36Trump announced an extra 100% tariff on Chinese imports, with an intended start date of Nov 1, 2025 (on top of existing tariffs), and vowed new export controls on â€œcriticalâ€ U.S. software. (funny enough that I market November as my next window of risk target, during the summerâ€¦)I spent April to explain you the geo situation and the motives of the sides. There I explained that this war wonâ€™t be over soon. It is a serious battle, Trump and Xi are prepared. However, note that I donâ€™t expect serious escalation until next spring.Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Transport announced a special port service fee on US-built/owned/flagged/operated vessels calling at Chinese ports, effective Tue, Oct 14. MOFCOM and GAC issued new controls on some medium/heavy rare-earth-related items and technologies, with implementation dates in November/December depending on the annex. Also the State Administration for Market Regulation opened an antitrust probe tied to Qualcommâ€™s Autotalks deal. The interesting thing is the same pattern I saw in Aprilâ€¦ that yields spiked during the after-hour or asian trading session after yields crushing moves. This makes me think that China is quietly, deliberately selling US treasuries. Including the offshore custodians, China still holds around US approximately $1.8â€‘1.9â€¯trillion in US bonds.While officially it is down by 6.44% and hit the lowest level since 2008. But I emphatize, that Beijing has hidden reserves held through offshore custodians (Euroclear in Belgium, Clearstream in Luxembourg) and stateâ€‘owned banks.So, they can treat with selling UST without significantly hurting themselves.China is preparing to inflict asymmetric pain on US highâ€‘tech industries via rare-earth restrictions, and can target active pharmaceutical ingredients, battery components and cleanâ€‘energy inputs (e.g., graphite) that are difficult to substitute, in order to choke global supply chains. Also the State Council planned to review a roadmap for yuanâ€‘backed stablecoins, with Hong Kong and Shanghai tasked to fastâ€‘track the rollout, aiming to boost global adoption of the yuan. Such digital tokens could allow Chinese firms to settle international trade without touching the dollar. Also, they launched AxCNH, the worldâ€™s first regulated offshore yuanâ€‘stablecoin in Kazakhstan, using technology from the Conflux blockchain network. These are the potential headline risks and responses from China to counter US pressure. SubscribeLetâ€™s look at the OpEx positioningâ€¦WEEKLY POSITIONINGHere you can see the weekly positioning: This is a net positive speed profile, also we have net long vanna and net short charm into the Friday expo. I donâ€™t see convexity shifts, so no fly pattern on the horizont. This speed profile means, that to the upside the gamma is increasing, and it is decreasing to the downside. The steepness is not too significant. Making it easier for the spot to climb upward, but volatility should be sold, telling us that the spot â€˜accepts the environmentâ€™. This comes hand in hand with longer vanna profile, meaning that mechanically the dealer profile becomes longer vega if price climbs upward, making them to sell volatility. And if volatility is sold, they become shorter delta, making them to buy futures supporting the spot to the upside. Meanwhile, negative charm flow makes dealers shorter delta as time passes, generating a relatively weak passive buyback flow into the OpEx. This flow will be significant on Thursday and Friday. SubscribeThe net gamma and net vega exposures of the profile are both negative.So this creates a very vol-sensitive (â€œleft-tail sensitiveâ€) positioning. This is mitigated a bit by the net long color (gamma decay) exposure, but I estimate only a 16-17% gamma increase over the week, still remaining in the negative territory. The profile is also long veta and short vomma. And this is a very important part!The long veta (vega decay) profile creates a passive and decreasing vol selling flow into Wednesday. VIX pin at 21s is very likely into VIX expo, but I will reassume it on Tuesday. However the short vomma (gamma of vega) exposure makes the profile even more sensitive to vol squeezes. (Below, I share the areas that the profile implies for vol crush and vol squeeze) However, the most important part of the profile for me is, that we are in long zomma territory! And it is even longer to the downside. Zomma is the gamma change to volatility. It is only positive at the very tails. It means vol up/gamma up, vol down/gamma down. This is a mathematically inbuilt mechanism, because the system is designed to not let volatility to be squeezed to infinity, or to be crushed to zero. Because if vol spikes, downside gammas will go up as well, flattening the speed profile and generating a â€œbrakeâ€ effect to the downside through long gamma hedging (trading futures against the direction compressing the intraday realized returns). When I see long zomma, it always tells me that market expects that the spot reached the very tails of the local curve on the scrutinized tenor. In this case, this is the left-tail: (just imagine the functions pushed lower on the y-axis until the gamma and vomma curves reaches negative territory)This is why I donâ€™t see the fly pattern, because the center would be even more higher, where vanna and speed shift to negative.So this tells me, that the market doesnâ€™t expect more downside, unless more macro trigger (China) occurs. If it does, sub-6400 is the target.

We have VIX expo as well, and VIX below 17s will be pinned towards 14s, as its vanna/charm flow is suppressive above, there is a steep local short fly on VIX. If 17s is broken as a result of FOMC, 21s is the main target, would result in a 6655.22 - 6513.36 (margin of error of 6479.06) for SPX.The positioning clearly implies that market is priced into the very tail of the curve, and while both vanna and speed exposures are negative, longer spot/vol beta would still result in a cap upside. Market is locked up into a range, with downside is well-supported, and this takes me to think that window of risk opens after post-OpEx Tuesday.

This complacency must be washed out. With COR1M being aggressively pushed down too (usually happening before corrections):While SPX barely made new highs in terms of EUR: Rotation remains the base case, while small caps are price in a vol event into FOMC. (In my read, FOMC is priced in, vol event is only to force Powell to take steps the way DJ wishes.)Watch this zone on ES=F as it is a major sentiment shifting pivot with primal downside target of the 90-days SMA (and November lows for left-tail): The moments are very much unbalanced, and market simply cannot get enough bid to go above 7k. And I strongly think, that some volatility will come now, but not bearish turn yet. The market zone is crucial. PCE & BoJWe have PCE this week and BoJ rate decision.  Sentiment is shifting towards â€œbad news is bad newsâ€/â€good news is good newsâ€, but not too big reaction.For BoJ, most coverage points to a hold at 0.75% (after the December hike to 0.75%). As said in the yearly post, I expect a pause in rate hikes during the first half of the year. Which, if markets are leaning that way too, reduces the chance of a rates shockâ€¦ but it heightens the sensitivity to any sign the BoJ is drifting away from that patience. So now, carry conditions can persist.However, if communication pushes investors to price earlier tightening, US momentum stock - selling can be expected (Japanese investors have accumulated dollars and bought US equities and bonds, often unhedged, in part because the yen depreciated for years and Japanese policy rates were extremely low). It depends on how much the gov worries of the near-term import inflation. SubscribeLetâ€™s scrutinize what the market is telling us about the structure, what is their bet..

Market analysisPCE - Intraday post (25/Sept)Sep 26, 2025âˆ™ Paid10ShareIn the weekly post, I marked the 6569.00 - 6599.61 area for SPX as the area that can be produced under the on-going vomma supply. Yesterday the area was hit, volatility tempered there and market rebounded and got pinned to the local magnet of 6600. Also marked 6580.47 as the level that confirms any downside move. It was tested but held firmly, so nothing happened that breaks the structure. SubscribeI marked yesterday that SPX/yields beta is shifting towards positive, it closed above zero yesterday: pushing the short-term sentiment towards â€œgood news are good newsâ€ territory. PCE print is important. It is expected to come at 0.28â€“0.35% m/m. This is because of shelter, while PCE has heavier weights on goods prices, which fell.Anyway, a print above 0.25% m/m would push threeâ€‘month annualised core PCE above 3.5%, raising doubts about disinflation.However, with this SPX/yields beta value, a very high surprise would be necessary to shake the sentiment. Algos wonâ€™t react negatively to a moderately inflationary print. But it is only short-term. The window of risk is open until buyback blackout ends in October.*update: sorry, for the late post, my internet is shit nowadaysâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market is a bit uncertain about how it should value the datas it has and tech of course. Trump wants to manage debt burden, Powell wants to manage inflation. On the short-run, the sentiment leans towards bad news are good news. So, market leans towards Trumpâ€™s pov, and wants stimulus on the short-run. Market is more concerned of growth. But needs confirmation in this sentiment by assuring investors that inflation will be managed and keeping rates lower is necessary.This is very well reflected in the price action, as spot just stopped at the primal weekly upside target, and now volatility starts to become more sensitive. For today, the market is still confidently selling puts, but not as confidently as before, while does not expect 6880/6900 to be broken this week. it shows a pattern that they fear the malign market reaction for a weak PCE print, while it would provide room for the Fed to cut (both in terms of growth metrics and marketâ€™s wealth effect wiseâ€¦ not too much tho, but more than nothing).This is why I said: pivotal window here.â€Now, the following PCE number is the Sept data. October and November are missing. The Streetâ€™s expectation is core PCE â‰ˆ 0.2â€“0.3% m/m, about 2.9% y/y, basically expecting it above 2% with a trend lower. Sentiment is tested and stays in â€œbad news are good newsâ€ and â€œgood news are bad newsâ€. Because market wants â€˜roomâ€™ for the Fed to cut rates, as it is concerned of the potential hawkishness. Market wants a stable easing cycle. So a bad PCE and a bit of sell would be good for the markets. They are like â€œeither the PCE will give teh Fed some room, or Fed will temper the sentimentâ€.Ok, how I play it?Well, I signaled dip buying on Nov 20, when SPX was at ~6540I said this week, when the spot touched the upside weekly pivot around 6860 to take some profit. I donâ€™t bet on selloff, I rather like â€œeither buy the dip, or hold the positions waiting for the Fedâ€™s signalâ€. There is no place to gamble here. Macro is messy. I donâ€™t expect headline grabbing big trades, also not expect catastrophic or any game-changer print, rather a supportive but rather ambiguous print. And the later Fed interpretations will be the key factors that can cause sentiment shifts.

Market analysisPivotal weeks ahead - Weekly post (1-5/Dec)Nov 30, 2025âˆ™ Paid2321ShareLiterally at the bottom on Nov20, I was a cautious bull, and warned everybody to donâ€™t be bearish there (even shared my call buyings). Said that I expeced consolidation into Monday and risk-taking come back on Tuesday.I marked the Oct27 gap as the main area that the SPX must re-conquer and build a structure in order to ease bearish pressure. The weekly positionings and intraday premarket analyses showed us, that the market is very confident about realized volatility decline in this area as they expect supportive liquidity to come in. (RV has slightly declined)â€¦ SubscribeI already shared charts, where I showed you that market didnâ€™t really give us 6-10% declines after the quick and aggressive April rebound, as it usually gave during earlier occasions. Even if I take the overnight ranges into account, this recent decline was only a 5.98% pullback. A momentum-wise proportional amplitude should be more than a 6.49% pullback, that would wash out most of the risks, that should have been happen around 6697.78 (down to ~6248.55); however from the current highst, it should give a 7.27% decline from 6921.88 in order to wash out the risk (based on past-momentum analyses), roughly down to ~6418.65, that is fair close enough to the WoR downside target that I got from other quantitative analyses. Now, the question is, as always, what are the possibilities, and what is the pivot that will reveal it for us.Iâ€™ll speak Elliott-wave theory now in order to make it more clear. What is the difference between the two scenarios?Well, in the first scenario the recent pullback is not finished, this current rebound will not take out the highs, and we will get a very sharp last wave hit to the low of around 6418; the smaller structureâ€™s C-wave align with the last one. However, in the second case, the case, the B-wave is a bulltrap, with an impulsive (hence more stable) 5-wave pattern, signaling a more sustained rally potentially up towards 7138, even to 7200; before the C-wave starts to materialize, a way bigger one, after late-Q1.Now, the key pivotal daily area is at 6760/70; that tells us which scenario the market gives us. Any pullback, retest that will occur now, should ultimately hold this area in order to prove us bullish continuation. Well, the headache is that volatility-wise it is the second scenario, but my momentum metrics are showing that there is more downside probability, like in scenario one.Fed is keyAs said, this shake-out is very serious, deep, investor-generated and fundamental. The question is if the repricing would be immediate or will be delayed in to Q2.For now, FOMC rate decision is key, as I said, Fed should bail out the sentiment. If they cut, it will be hawkish, but the question is, how hawkish they will be. How much risk do they place on the inflation vs growth. Logically, the bigger animal is growth and the ever-growing debt burden. Thatâ€™s the real issue, and thatâ€™s what we have seen all over this rebound that the admin kept forcing the market up and up, even only on mechanical flows. As smart/â€organicâ€ money takes even smaller part of the daily and weekly flows, the impact of mechanical flows will grow. I already posted about it. Also the technical perspectives support this. So logically the odds still favor for the second scenario. For a sustained rally, the sentiment must be supportive.SubscribeNow, I will scrutinize the weekly positioning to see what levels the trader are watching, where are the dynamically important areas, and what the market is actually betting onâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisPlaying the AI-Bubble; Long-term outlook Bitcoin, SPX, Tech, AI-Bubble opportunitiesJul 22, 2025âˆ™ Paid7698ShareIn this post I will write about the bubble present in the marketâ€”its role and its potential. Iâ€™ll describe the conditions for further inflating the bubble, my target levels, and Iâ€™ll discuss the most important companies that offer great opportunities in the â€˜economy of the futureâ€™. Iâ€™ll also outline my expectations and plan for Bitcoin, and explain how its fundamentals have changed, which is why Iâ€™ll now treat it as an investment. SubscribeAre we in a bubble? Absolutely. In a purposely inflated tech-bubble. Will it burst now? It should, but it wonâ€™t. Tech now comprises 34% of the SPX, that is higher than during the 1999 dotcom peak, with overheated valuation. This started to exponentially accelerate after COVID. This acceleration is good for the insiders because it enables HF algo trading to exacerbate moves, it can force policy responses (rate cuts/hikes) in weeks rather than quarters, and creates liquidity spirals that insiders can exploit by timing entry and exit more precisely than ever.Credit conditions are tighter than preâ€‘2008, but derivatives exposures, leverage in nonbank financial firms, debt burden and the soâ€‘called â€œeverything bubbleâ€ (across equities, housing, commodities, crypto) tell us systemic fragilities akin to 2007â€“08. And it looks pretty much like the bubble will be inflated further by easing.The goal is to buy out opponents from the important sectors (AI, quantum-computing) and restructure the global economy.

# Post-CPI, SPX to yields beta flip + Intraday post (12/June)

> Yesterday, I signaled you that my reversion model gave the 80%+ signal for a reversion what Iâ€™ve been waiting for to go short.

Market analysisPost-CPI, SPX to yields beta flip + Intraday post (12/June)Jun 12, 2025âˆ™ Paid111ShareYesterday, I signaled you that my reversion model gave the 80%+ signal for a reversion what Iâ€™ve been waiting for to go short. Market fell 70 pts+ since. However, momentum and sentiment-wise, as long as SPX can close above 5955, ES=F above 5968.10, NDX above 21,549.18 and NQ=F above 21,603.46, pullback is not confirmed. The SPX/yields beta flipped to positive just right ahead of CPI release, as I expected on Sunday. Market reacted to softer prints as it was signaled by the beta: reacting with pullback for a softer-than-expected print. This marks a shift to a regime where yield moves are dominated by term-premium normalizationâ€”driven by fiscal deficits and heavy issuanceâ€”and anchored inflation expectations. Stable core inflation prints and clear forward guidance have convinced markets the Fed will look through term-premiumâ€“driven yield spikes unless core CPI deviates markedly, decoupling long yields from immediate policy-rate risk. Postâ€CPI data confirm real yields climbing, break-even inflation subdued, and term premium elevatedâ€”hallmarks of a growth-driven yield regime. The equity-risk premium has fallen toward zero, and valuation indicators (e.g., Shiller CAPE in the 94th percentile) warn stocks are richly priced, so positive yield shocks now often trigger a â€œcatch-upâ€ bid in equities and vice versa. Core CPI at 2.8% Y/Y and moderate headline prints have reassured markets that the Fed will â€œlook throughâ€ term-premium-driven yield spikes, decoupling long yields from near-term rate-hike risks.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 139,000 in Mayâ€”above expectationsâ€”with wage growth accelerating, underscoring broad-based labor resilience rather than a cooling trend. Despite rate-cut hopes, traders now see only a 23% chance of a July cut and 76% by Septemberâ€”down from peaksâ€”reflecting respect for labor-market resilience over headline CPI alone.The thing is that the elevation (higher lows) is an underlying trend in the beta. Markets now fear a growth slowdown or even deflationary shock more than runaway inflation, so soft economic prints (lower yields) now drag equities down. Contrary to the old â€œFed putâ€ mentality, weak data can no longer be reflexively positive because it undermines the growth cue in yields. The Fedâ€™s pivot point has moved: it cares less about term-premium ticks and more about core inflation and labor dynamicsâ€”reinforcing that only a genuine downturn will prompt cuts.And it was the real underlying concern during May, and it flipped on Tuesday-Wednesday. Letâ€™s see, if this trend continues. SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Statement says they will carefully assess â€œthe extent and timingâ€ of additional adjustments â€“ language normally used when theyâ€™re signaling only a pause of QT rather than a new full easing cycle. Powell explicitly framed this as the third â€œrisk-managementâ€ cut, aimed at stabilizing a labor market that has slowed sharply, while inflation is still above 2% and boosted by tariffs.I donâ€™t see a deep cutting cycle unless the labor data really cracks.In the weekly post I wrote: â€œMonday is expected to be a cautiously malign day, market prepositions itself for the week, while Tuesday is hedging and waiting for the FOMC.On FOMC day I expect the Fed to be very â€œfather figure likeâ€ hawkish to warn about the reality and risks. This is a â€œreconstructiveâ€ tone. Market will reprice the easing cycle, ultraoptimism if any. [Powell was more dovish than expected, but warned about the reality!]Thursday is the day of profit taking and rebalancing of previous trades (mostly causing sme couter-moves)â€¦â€ Here we are. Donâ€™t be biased!And donâ€™t be afraid of a potential downside retest. Structurally, as long as SPX does not break 6789.19 on daily, the rebound continues.

NVDA isnâ€™t just expected to be good; itâ€™s expected to be perfect again. NVDAâ€™s data-center revenue is heavily concentrated in a small number of mega-customers (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, META, plus AI clouds like CoreWeave). Those customers have jacked up AI capex to eye-watering levels, but on recent calls some (esp. Meta) have started talking about being more â€œdisciplinedâ€ on AI infra spend and acknowledging that near-term ROI is uncertain.If some hyperscalers are slowing orders, then it will be a sign that AI build-out is peaking. Note, that CoreWeave cut full-year revenue guidance and blamed a delay at a third-party data-center developer; stock dropped ~10%, its margins are being squeezed by rising infrastructure costs, higher AI-chip prices and fierce competition, despite strong demand.

As written in the weekly post, veta supply (positive vega decay) that caps the volatility exponentially diminishes today into Thursday, and will be gone tomorrow. However, vomma supply is still with us that slows down â€˜vol upâ€™ moves, preventing vol squeezes.So it gives room for volatility to go up, but not much today, rather tomorrow, however in a managed, dampened way. I will show you what ranges and levels the market expects under this conditionâ€¦Why is it important?Because in a â€˜bad news are good newsâ€™ regime, good news are bad news. And market doesnâ€™t expect disinflation. The sentiment on growth scare is short-term bullish as it forces the Fed to ease, but inflationary numbers narrow the room for ease and increase the odds of hawkishness beside a cut. However, the underlying growth scare is stronger and dominates the longer-term sentiment, so the effect of â€˜good news = bad newsâ€™ is not too big, but we will see how today the bond market closes.Tariff pass-through is now showing up in goods. PPI is expected to come out cooler after July hot print with y/y around 3.3%, but tomorrow, core CPI (the one that Fed actually watches) is expected to increase due to tariffs by a 0.3% m/m and 3.1% y/y.

# PPI, OpEx, Intraday post (15/May)

---

Market analysisPPI, OpEx, Intraday post (15/May)May 15, 2025âˆ™ Paid123SharePPI + SPX/LTY correlationEconomists forecast the April PPI to rise 0.2% month-over-month, a modest uptick after recent tariff-related shocks and y/y PPI to hold near 2.5%, given the lagged effects of commodity swings and tariff pass-through. Fedâ€funds futures now price nearâ€zero odds of a June cut and push the first easing into July, even as ECB insiders now see a June rate reduction as probable but expect only a 25 bp move, not a large adjustment, and the BoE just cut to 4.25%, setting the stage for additional quarterâ€point moves later in the year. PPI outcomes could nudge but not derail the Fedâ€™s hold decision.Now, you have to understand, that the market wants to get rid of recessionary fears. They concentrate on growth now that is equal to inflation as well now (stagflation). This is why, over the past few weeks, whenever the quant models suggested a healthy pullback, the government literally intervened and released benign announcements to trigger supportive buying. Why? Simply because the deflationary risk is real. They need to keep it going until the planned events unfold and investment interest strengthens. If you followed my April post, you know.A stronger PPI print suggests robust demand and firmer pricing power, alleviating some recession fears even as it keeps inflation risks alive. This is why we see increased SPX/LTY correlation. Soft print now means growth concerns, while strong print means growth optimism. But upside is capped due to stagflation. Rollover risk, supplyâ€shock inflation, and layoff fears are looming there that will roil fixed-income more than equities.OPEXWe have AM OpEx tomorrow, and the positioning will effect todayâ€™s price action. The first we see is and IC at 5850/5855/5900/5905; but in fact we have a short fly structure with 5848.63 - 5853.26 as the centroid of the profile. The speed profile above and below is equally positive and negative, and putting the net profile into flat-to-positive with a slope of 1.59% Very low vanna tailwind. Charm decay favors for buyback flow, but only until SPX holds the support. Position-wise, more things points down, than up. To the upside, the key inflection point would be 5939.42, with vol up scenario. And to the downside, it is 5772.91 again, with vol up. Now, yesterday SPX close indicates a 64.81% probability for reversion, simply based on momentum only, and 63.72% for ES=F. Look at realized vol metrics: The trend is going on, and vol of vol doesnâ€™t show sign of cooling. With correlation violently decreased, the volatility is getting more and more sensitive to any spikes. For now, I donâ€™t think we will see any vol squeeze in the next montly window. But I do think, that a slower pullback will start, and we should see if SPX can build a stable supporting structure filling the gaps. Odds favors for benign outcome until June FOMC and OpEx window. But we will see, when we are there. (I still think, the pivot will come when supply shocks hit.) But what is more interesting is the VIX complex. VVIX troughed at 85.16 on May 13, 2025, followed by spot VIX at 17.65 and front-month VIX futures at 17.83 on the same day. The VIX9D and VIX3M indices bottomed on May 13 at 16.83 and 19.50. May VIX futures expire on May 21, 2025, and the June contract trades at 19.7440, roughly 1.12 vol points above spot VIX at 18.62, offering a buffer against mild selling.With term structure in moderate contango (June > spot), a measured equity pullback towards 5749.62 could rebuild bullish setup into June.

# Recession, Stagflation, Risk + Intraday post (1/May)

Market analysisRecession, Stagflation, Risk + Intraday post (1/May)May 01, 2025âˆ™ Paid201ShareIn my yesterday post you can read my insights on the coming datas and Fed. Very important. Bessent said de-escalation â€œis up to China,â€ because Chinese exports to the U.S. dwarf U.S. exports to China. He doubled down on a strong-dollar policy and warned Europe may need to cut rates to counter the euroâ€™s strength. Euro-zone consumersâ€™ three-year inflation expectations rose to 2.5%, up from 2.4%, indicating that the public is bracing for lasting price pressures even before tariffs bite fully. McDonaldâ€™s reported a 1% year-on-year drop in global comparable sales for Q1 2025, versus analyst forecasts of a 0.95% rise. And it keeps dropping.Weaker consumer spending and ongoing tariff escalation raise the risk of stagflation. Recent steep drops in copper futures (down 8.4% in April 2025) amid Chinese PMI weakness and tradeâ€war jitters underscore growing recessionary risks that are not yet fully reflected in broader markets. If you watch the rhetoric from the government and the Fed, itâ€™s all about recession. Why? As I wrote over the weekend, the biggest and most immediate risk is a deflationary spiral. So theyâ€™re focused on stopping that first. The market knows itâ€”speculators and mechanical flows can fuel a rally on that. Listenâ€¦Come June, itâ€™s very likely the Fed will be forced to cut rates. I emphasize â€œforcedâ€â€”not because all danger is past and growth can resume, but because theyâ€™ll have to act to avoid a deflationary spiral. Yet QE wouldnâ€™t make sense given the stagflation backdrop. The market is currently underpricing that risk. So donâ€™t expect genuine QEâ€”only as real as 2022â€™s QT was.This is a bear-market rally. And as I canâ€™t stress enough, come mid-summerâ€”when tariff-driven inflation kicks inâ€”the market is going to tank hard. Thereâ€™s no investor confidence underpinning this rally; itâ€™s purely a liquidity hunt.Youâ€™ve got to be extremely nimble and adaptable in this environment, because itâ€™s so heavily driven by policymakersâ€™ narratives. The market is mostly front-running them.But to time the decline is simply impossible now. In its Aprilâ€“June 2025 quarter, the Treasury expects to borrow $514 billion of net marketable debt, almost $150 billion more than prior estimatesâ€”assuming an end-June TGA of $850 billion. That $514 billion of new issuance flows directly into the TGA, removing an equivalent amount of reserves from banks and money markets. The Q2 marketable borrowing and the postâ€“debt-ceiling replenishment of the TGA together will withdraw hundreds of billions from reserves just as the Fed is debating rate cuts. This reserve drain tightens funding conditions, amplifying the recessionary and stagflationary pressures youâ€™ve already identifiedâ€”and puts the Fed under even more pressure to ease despite sticky inflation.Two-year Treasury yields have already dropped below the Fedâ€™s funds rate (4.25â€“4.50%), signaling markets expect rate cuts imminently. On the day jobless claims jumped, the 10-year yield slipped to 4.15%, and S&P 500 futures ralliedâ€”classic sign that weaker labor data leads to lower yields and risk-asset inflows. Powell has said rate cuts depend on clear signs of rising unemployment and slowing GDPâ€”â€œonly if unemployment hits and GDPâ€ targets are met. With the unemployment rate still near 4.2% and claims elevated but not crisis-level, immediate yield drops are manageable. However, further jobless jumps could force two-year yields down by 100+ basis points in a matter of weeksâ€”amplifying funding-market stress and potentially triggering margin calls in leveraged sectors. A large, rapid yield decline can disrupt money-market funds, bank balance sheets, and short-term funding, compounding the recessionary drag of rising unemployment.INTRADAY POST Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Review of One Year's Performance | A year has passed

Review of One Year's Performance | A year has passedReview of the first year of my substackFeb 03, 2026âˆ™ Paid3183ShareA year has passed. Iâ€™d like to thank all of you for your supportâ€”both moral and financialâ€”and for the trust youâ€™ve placed in me.So let this post stand here as a reflection on the period behind us: Iâ€™ll review my own performance, share a few small updates, and announce an anniversary subscription discount.IntroductionItâ€™s been a year since I launched this Substack page, after a Twitter thread I posted in January 2024 about the dynamics of a vanna squeeze suddenly led to a surge of new followers. Over time, I increasingly felt that I wanted to shareâ€”on a daily basisâ€”how I prepare for day trading ahead of the U.S. market open; back then, I often shared my trade signals as well.Even then, some people tried to discredit me in various ways in pursuit of their own business interests; others offered me workâ€”or outright plagiarized my content. My analyses were bold and accurate (with the exception of the Juneâ€“July 2024 gamma squeeze, when I was adapting on the fly). After only three months, hundreds of you asked me to create my own platform. When I didnâ€™t, by the autumn of 2024 many of you were asking me to at least set up a â€œBuy Me a Coffeeâ€ page so you could show your appreciation for my work.In the end, my Substack launched in early February 2025, and in a single year it has grown to more than 2,500 subscribersâ€”without any targeted marketingâ€”despite shadow bans, divisive topics such as my geopolitical outlooks, and continued attempts to undermine my credibility.Among my subscribers youâ€™ll find a wide range of people: from high-ranked senior fund managers and economists, to market makers, to individual retail speculatorsâ€¦ a truly wonderful, diverse community.This year has challenged me in several ways, too. I had to learn how to tailor my thoughts and analyses as optimally as possible to the needs of roughly two thousand subscribers, and to communicate them clearly and in a structured way.That took time on my partâ€”and patience on your partâ€”since Iâ€™m inexperienced when it comes to services like this. But I think weâ€™re on the right track.Thank you to those of you who believed in me.Iâ€™ve had private conversations with a number of them to ask what they find compelling about my work. Their feedback has been strikingly consistent, and it almost always boils down to three key points:1) I donâ€™t compromise my integrity. During the April crash, a lot of traders arrived from other Discord servers looking for a â€œfree lunch.â€ Even then, I stayed grounded in a probability-based framework and didnâ€™t jump onto the popular finfluencer/guru bandwagon. I accepted the statistical consequences of that choiceâ€”and the reality that some of those people would leave disappointed and then spread lies about me.2) A stochastic, probabilistic mindset. Although my models can anticipate trends with high accuracy, I avoid absolute statements and I do not introduce bias that couldâ€”even subconsciouslyâ€”impair readersâ€™ judgement. Day after day, I explain and remind everyone of the marketâ€™s reality: in markets we bet on probability distributions, and we hedge probability distributions. I explicitly acknowledge that outcomes are conditionalâ€”and that an analystâ€™s job is to identify those conditions and the highest-probability scenarios implied by them, not to â€œpredictâ€ in a fortune-telling sense. The market is only highly predictable when the confidence level is genuinely highâ€”and the underlying conditions are clearly defined.3) Breadth of analysis. I track both macro context and micro-level dynamics. I donâ€™t overemphasize either; instead I adjust the weights of different determinants as their relevance changes. This is hard workâ€”because, as one fund manager put it, Iâ€™m effectively doing the work of an entire research-desk team on my own.+1) Value for money. Some of you also emphasized that while the macro and micro data I work with are expensiveâ€”and processing them requires serious work and learning, not to mention building my individual models and evaluating the data (the product of a lifetime of study)â€”the subscription price remains significantly lower than what you would expect, especially given the accuracy. And thatâ€™s true: I initially shared everything for free, and today I charge a friendly price because this is not my full-time jobâ€”and because I want people with smaller savings to be able to be here as well. So I set what I consider a minimal, fair fee for the work.Changes and outlookAs I promised at launchâ€”and repeatedly over the past yearâ€”I am increasing the subscription price. This does not affect existing subscriptions (just as the switch to euros didnâ€™t). From now on, new subscribers can access the analyses for â‚¬52 per month. There will be no further increases.However, until the end of February, a 35% discount will be available, bringing the cost for the next year close to the previous price. You can access this offer via this link. Iâ€™ve also launched a referral program: youâ€™ll receive a unique referral link, and new free subscribers who join through it will count as â€œreferrals.â€ You should have received a separate automated email about this.Beyond that, more educational posts are comingâ€”some in video format. I have a strong accent, so be prepared. Iâ€™m also planning short free podcasts on general market topics, geopolitics, and themes many of you have asked me to cover, such as the technical and philosophical perspectives of artificial intelligence.My models are under continuous development. I plan to recalibrate some models already in use and to build new ones (i.e., TradingView indicators for you). I have a lot of ideas.Originally, I planned to run this Substack for 1â€“1.5 years. At this point, Iâ€™m confident I can commit to the full 1.5 years. After August, weâ€™ll see what happens. I donâ€™t know how the next year will unfold, but with some of you Iâ€™ve agreed thatâ€”at worstâ€”I will continue publishing the weekly posts and sharing the macro and educational content.And now, Iâ€™d like to examineâ€”statisticallyâ€”how my analyses have performed over the past yearâ€¦Annual performance reviewI wonâ€™t share the exact code, because it is heavily AIâ€‘based. And in any case it requires a special computer setup, and on top of that I didnâ€™t write the neural network, claim graph, argument graph, assumption layer, etc. parts, because I donâ€™t have the expertise for thoseâ€¦ yet.Since a large part of the code is not my work, I canâ€™t make the backtest method fully transparent; however, at the end of this letter I will attach, in a zip file, the downloaded posts, and you can test them yourselves as well. This file will of course only be available to paid subscribers.In the backtest I examined the accuracy rate. Because my analyses are mostly conditional, I looked at what percentage of the dynamics assigned to price levels and ranges actually materialized. I also included the volatility environment in this.In addition, I extracted and backtested my predictive statements about macro processes separately on the longâ€‘term and shortâ€‘term timeframes. I examined, on the one hand, to what extent my forecasts were consistent with the available news and researchâ€‘desk publications, and on the other hand I also looked at how much time elapsed on average between my forecast and the forecasts on the same topic from the research desks available to me, and between the publicly documented start of the real processes and the forecasts. Then I calculated in what percentage of cases I was a frontâ€‘runner. Here, however, it is very important to keep in mind that quite a few forecasts have not yet materialized, so I also included those publicly available highâ€‘quality reports that warn that the process is beginning.When analyzing the weekly analyses, two problems arose. First, the sample is very small, so statistically it is difficult to draw significant conclusions from them. Second, I only started describing the expected weekly dynamics in a systematic and consistent way a few months ago, but I did not have sufficiently highâ€‘quality historical data to backtest these precisely. Therefore, for the weekly analyses the margin of error is very high, but the trend is well describable.I also did not include last yearâ€™s intraday trading signals in the backtest. Any subscriber can view these in the dedicated chat and backtest them.So the conclusion is that the edge of the intraday posts does not primarily come from the raw directional hitâ€‘rate, but from the fact that around the specified levels the market behaves according to the functions assigned by me.Here are the results:Intraday posts:The average hit rate of the levels derived from the speed profile is 64.85%, which includes both the levels themselves and the realization of the dynamics assigned to them.With a 95% CI, even the lower bound of the data is above 55%, and 27.91% is greater than or equal to 75%.Performance is driven by the levels and the dynamics assigned to them.However, there is an approximately âˆ’0.099 correlation with volatility, which means that during higher volatility performance deteriorates slightly. In calm market environments there were several days when the forecast was 80â€“100% accurate, i.e., it practically indicated that dayâ€™s move perfectly. In contrast, on very hectic daysâ€”when market volatility was exceptionally highâ€”the intraday hit rate dropped.Script inputs:As the inputs are not adjusted for skewness and kurtosis yet, we can expect that the general fat left-tail will distort the results towards underestimation.Expected 68.27% - realized 46.01%Expected 95.45% - realized 76.07%Expected 99.73% - realized 89.57%Expected 99.99% - realized 96.32%So the projected sigma most often underestimated the realized dispersion in the sample. This was distorted especially by the April events and the switch to Globex, because overnight price actions often generated significant gaps.However, after a downside touch, reversion occurred on average in 55.26% of cases. In the upside case, 36.59%; this characterizes the leftâ€‘tailed distribution well.Return to the geometric mean of the reversion bands after a downside hit occurred on average in 42.87% of cases, whereas after an upside hit only in 25.04%, and after an upside hit dispersion is higher and skewness is positive, which means that the higher the upside reversion band spot touches, the less likely spot is to return to the mean. In the downsideâ€‘hit case this dispersion is much smaller, and even at the lowest level it is above 33%. So the probability of downside level reversion is significantly higher.Weekly post and ranges:Upper level hit = 84.62%Lower level hit = 23.08%Trend shift (for the next week) after breaking the level = 69.23%Reversal after hitting lower level = 66.67%So the levels to the upside signal trend reversals wellâ€”exactly what they are meant to do. The lower levels most often function as reversion levels, but the sample size is small.The posts containing the weekly ranges also usually hinted at whether an upside or downside breakout from the range is expected, and whether overall I expect a bullish or bearish week. In this respect the hit rate turned out to be surprisingly high, around 66â€“69%. Based on the data, out of 13 weekly forecasts I correctly anticipated the next weekâ€™s trend direction in ~9 cases.Risk levelsThis is the strongest part. The definition of a risk level is that it is a trendâ€‘fail filter, a kind of â€œmake it or break it level.â€ So if price breaks through it, we can expect the trend to continue; if it rejects it, the trend does not continue.In the examined sample, acceptance at the upper risk was 62.90%, and at the lower risk 45.16%.When acceptance occurred, the dayâ€™s direction practically switched in a regimeâ€‘like way. In the case of upside acceptance, the mean return was +0.643% and the upâ€‘day ratio was 94.87%, while in the case of lower acceptance the mean return was âˆ’0.881% and the upâ€‘day ratio was only 10.71% (i.e., roughly 89% was a downâ€‘day). This behavior fits the â€œmake it or break itâ€ interpretation exactly: with risk acceptance the day enters trendâ€‘mode, therefore the classic meanâ€‘reversion expectation (e.g., back to Î¼) weakens significantly. The average Closeâ€‘toâ€‘Close effect for the next day was already more mixed (after upper hold average +0.290%, after lower hold average +0.418%), and it suggested that after lowerâ€‘risk acceptance a bounce often appears, whereas after upperâ€‘riskâ€‘level acceptance a more moderate followâ€‘through is seen.Macro predictions: Here the distribution is about 80% in the 0.6â€“0.8 band and 18â€“19% in the 0.8â€“1.0 band. The average is about 70.09â€“72.8%.My accurate forecasts preceded public sources by about 33% on average.61â€“71% of the accurate predictions appear before events with a median lead time of 56â€“61 days. (In the case of shortâ€‘term statements, this number disperses toward 77.7%.)These are extremely high ratios, especially in an area where predictability is made difficult by many unexpected factors (wars, election outcomes, diplomatic turns, energyâ€‘policy developments, regulatory changes, etc.).Time evolution:All performance fluctuates, including mine. The magnitude of the fluctuation began to subside in the first half of May, and performance started to increase. This is distorted, however, by the fact that in the first period the intraday posts did not yet have a refined, standardized format. Toward the end of the year there were fewer exceptionally lowâ€‘accuracy (20â€“30%) days, and high hitâ€‘rate (above 70%) days became more frequent. For weekly posts, performance rather stagnates at the levels described earlier, but it was strongest during the summer. Similarly, the accuracy of the geopolitical analyses also stagnates at high levels. So here a consistent methodology is present.Overall:The general average accuracy rate that can be converted into a trading edge falls between 59.64% and 61.38%, depending on weighting (equal weighted vs. levelâ€‘plusâ€‘dynamics weighted information). But a friend of mine calculated a 59.20â€“65.29% interval. Methodâ€‘dependent. It is important to keep in mind that this is not a classic winâ€‘rate (not â€œ6 wins out of 10 tradesâ€), but a 0â€“100 match score (combined score) that measures how closely the â€œmapâ€ described in the post played out in the market. This score simultaneously includes whether the specified levels actually came into play and how much the behavior/dynamics assigned to them (pivot reaction, centroid â€œmagnetâ€ characteristic, targetâ€‘fulfillment characteristic) were confirmed, and (if present) the bias/direction component as well.So if we hold everything constant, then, simplified, out of 12 months my analyses will be useful in 7.26 months, i.e., out of 252 trading days on 152 days the analyses will be accurate. So about 5 months, i.e., 100 days, when the analysis doesnâ€™t help much. However, the degree of accuracy also fluctuates along a spectrum, the median of which is 58.33% (dispersing upward). On the other hand, under a more conservative model (signâ€‘onâ€‘returnsâ€‘type, with the absolute value of normal returns) it indicates about a 1.84â€“2.54 annualized Sharpe, but under a more optimistic estimate (symmetric +1/âˆ’1 payoff for each signal, assuming a daily trade) 3.17 can also be derived. Both are significantly high values.(For comparison, the general accuracy rate of research desks is fluctuating around 40â€“50%.)I know this isnâ€™t the 85-90% accuracy rate that most furus claim for themselves, but at least itâ€™s true and well-auditableâ€¦The strongest points of my analyses, in order, are the macro context/bias, risk level, the speed profile levels (including weekly dynamics). Compared to these, the weekly ranges and reversion bands are weaker, but the accuracy still mostly disperses above the average, just only slightly. Some of my more important predictions from the past yearLetâ€™s review a few of my higher-impact predictions from the past yearâ€¦Februaryâ€“April window â€” I flagged the April drop days in advance, with then-unbelievable downside targets that were hit. Three days before it I calculated the bottom level to within 100 points (which, at 35.02% realized volatility, is well within a 1â€‘sigma daily range), and I said that this crash was one of the first signs of geopolitical restructuring â€” a â€œweighing machineâ€ momentum in Grahamâ€™s sense (not simple speculation).I predicted â€œhidden QEâ€ through Bessentâ€™s bond market operations, and the rebound even if I didnâ€™t expect such a sharp/fast rebound.Geopolitics -  I dedicated tons of posts for Trumpâ€™s geopolitical program: that there would be a USâ€“Russia rapprochement via Gulf mediation, and that the EU would be pushed toward a national economic model (which is why they will run to China for help) â€” and all of that is now happening (see NSS for example). Furthermore, with sudden events, I helped interpret themâ€”something that the majority of renowned and highly followed analysts failed to doâ€”and my interpretations ultimately proved correct (like UA-peace plan, Trump-Putin meeting, Venezuela, US-EU conflict, or Warshâ€™s plans).Correction in May â€” My primary WoR ran from the May ECB rate decision to mid-May (Trumpâ€™s visit to the Middle East). We saw a ~97-point decline in SPX, but the market did not break my target level from which momentum could have flipped into left-tail risk.(Later, a 124-point decline materialized after Trumpâ€™s visit, but that wasnâ€™t the risk I expected; it followed directly from weekly positioning with an exact target. The same applies to the 107-point decline in the 16â€“20 June week.)July/August window â€” Essentially my original major WoR: the post-NFP and FOMC period, once tariff effects began to show up in the data. I marked it into mid-August. The effects did start to appear, and we got a 215-point declineâ€”still not a break of the level that would have triggered the left-tail risk Iâ€™d been flagging.(In mid-August another 138-point decline followed, but again the structure held. By mid-July it had also become clear to me that the market would remain supported, and I emphasised that my WoR was shifting towards the post-September OpEx period.)Bitcoin trend and levels - Back in July, I predicted the Bitcoin local top to happen in October, marking it as the highest probability top.Gold up - In early August I forecast that a new momentum phase would begin â€” back when gold was still only at $3500 (and I warned my subs for the selloff of the speculative rally, one day before it happened). Post-September OpEx â€” I called for supportive flows into Monday and the WoR starting on Tuesday: that produced a 130.3-point pullback. I then called for volatility and vomma supply, and for the week of 6 October I flagged weakness and a potential vol spike into the Thuâ€“Fri window, which delivered a 213.8-point pullback.October 29 selloff - I publicly called it on twitter and called the bounce too at the bottom. It was a 398.42 pts selloff, and I called the bottom to tick and day just like in April.December rangebound - SPX barely made a 1.73% return since.BoJ rate policy-risk - Again, before it became a popular topic.And a lot of others along with micro flowsâ€¦ All things considered, I think there is still plenty of room for growth, and I also have ideas for the time that remains. But I believe weâ€™re perhaps not on the wrong path, are we? Iâ€™d like to thank you once again for the trust and the tremendous support Iâ€™ve received from all of you.

Market analysisRight-tail, right-tail and right-tail... - Intraday post (12/Sept)Sep 12, 2025âˆ™ Paid10ShareOn the weekly basis, the right-tail was realized by SPX being agressively pushed upwards on every stagflationary news: Due to the Bessent-put, the momentum was expected, but I didnâ€™t expected it to be let to run this far this fast, but the futures roll-over started earlier, helping the upward momentum.You can see, that while vol of vol remains suppressed in a net basis, it realized a bit upward, after SPX broke the zone that was market by vomma supply on the weekly tenor: Volatility remains sticky around 9.43%; with a slight spot up/vol up after the momentum broke out of the marked ranges.This keeps risk high, and holds back vol control and CTA funds to increase their long exposure on equities. Funny enough, that SPX/yields correlation started to grind upwards again, after these events, creating a short-term â€œgood news = good newsâ€ regime for algos, ahead of the coming rate cuts. So, inflationary pressures will be taken as a positive growth signal.The moderation of the realized meassures of this spot-upstick comes from the monthly exposure working in the background: We can expect some ranging into the FOMC at these elevated rates. This sudden, fast spike in the spot made a 92.13% reversion signal appear in my model, a very rare signal, with vol adjusted mean of 6363.25This can be moderated through time correction, but the modelâ€™s meassured risk constantly remains above 80%; this is why I donâ€™t take longer-term positions. Until this risk isnâ€™t washed out of the market. Again, I expect the window of risk starting after the OpEx (simply because the narrative will be gone), but we will see the next weekly positioning on Sunday how the Sept OpEx positioning evolves. However, the window of risk will be over by some statement from the admin, like tech based global trade announcement, or partial trade deals with asia, etc. I patiently wait. I see no reason to risk my hard earned profitsâ€¦ SubscribeLetâ€™s look at todayâ€™s positioningâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

With little new â€œtoolboxâ€ left for Trump, beyond the justâ€‘expiring 90â€‘day tariff truce, a further unwind in bonds could trigger a sharp equity pullback this summerâ€”forcing the Fed into an risky choice between engineering a crash (and eventual QE with â€œonâ€‘paperâ€ inflation spiking) or preâ€‘emptively easing right after PCE data.

Market analysisRunning out of time, US/China war (+intraday post 11/April)Apr 11, 2025âˆ™ Paid3462ShareDear viewers and readers, it looks like we wonâ€™t have to wander far for our daily dose of excitement today either! The US/China viagra-supercharged cockfight continues, with China in the left corner getting ready to unleash yet another round of hits, while the US in the right corner does its best to absorb every blow and pray its backers donâ€™t throw in the towel. In the stands, the Russian and Arab delegationsâ€”whoâ€™ve been rooting for the US as their favoriteâ€”keep shouting, â€œFuck, get yourself together!â€ Meanwhile, theyâ€™re clearly still undecided about whether to sponsor him for the upcoming season. As for Lady Europe, previously known in the tabloids as USâ€™ sweetheart, is in a hysterical frenzy, being clearly unsure yet whose bankroll she wants to gold-dig from in the futureâ€¦Currentlyâ€¦Violent sell-offs in risk assets, surges in gold, cash, and safe currencies, and record volatilityâ€¦Safe-haven assets have surged. Gold prices rocketed above $3,200/oz to all-time highs as investors sought shelter amid a weaker U.S. dollar and recession fears. In fact, gold is up ~21% year-to-date, buoyed by crisis hedging demand and large inflows into gold ETFs. The Swiss franc hit a 10-year high vs USD and the yen strengthened to multi-month highs. U.S. Treasuries saw chaotic trading: paradoxically, long-term yields spiked in a â€œdash for cashâ€ even as rate-cut expectations grew. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to ~4.45% (â‰ˆ+45 bps in one week, the sharpest rise since 2001)â€‹, and 30-year yields neared 4.9% (largest weekly jump since 1982)â€‹.Japan and China has started to sell as predicted. Meanwhile, short-term Treasuries and cash have been in high demand, with safe-haven inflows of ~$18.8 billion into Treasury funds in a week â€“ the largest ever, according to BofA dataâ€‹. Incoming data and policy communications also reflect the immediate fallout. Price pressures are mixed â€“ consumer prices unexpectedly fell in March (a sign that demand may be weakening) even as tariffs raise some costs. Core inflation could still spike later (PIMCO estimates U.S. core CPI may reach ~4.5% if tariffs fully pass through), but near-term, deflationary signals have appeared. The Federal Reserve is pivoting toward easing: traders now bet the Fed will cut rates by ~100 bps by end-2025, with rate reductions possibly restarting as soon as June.

Now, what is interesting for me, is that intraday we can keep seeing upside realized vol and realized vol of vol selling, that reinforces the small effect of the weekly zomma supply. This is how the casino collects the chips from upside vol bettors. Because all those upside vols will be eventually dumped as reality checks in. What is the purpose? Well, first collecting premiums from long vol 0DTE gamblers. And second, as we are in a â€˜downside-hedge unwindingâ€™ phase, plus we are at the gates of the buyback window, and like that the upside long vol bets increased. Squeeze up = risk, because volatility = risk. However, most of them donâ€™t see the headwind, because it happens intraday, and it is not directly IV selling, but it is RV selling.This tells me, that the big players want stability. They donâ€™t want upside risk to accumulate, especially trading at a momentum-wise pivotal area (see: weekly post).Primary trend still constructive, but headline sensitivity is high (tariffs, sanctions, Fed). CTAs are net buyers but they are cutting, and remain so until 6640/30 are breaks.SubscribeLetâ€™s look at todayâ€™s positioningâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Sentiment check - Intraday post (26/Dec)

Market analysisSentiment check - Intraday post (26/Dec)Dec 26, 2025âˆ™ Paid9ShareWeekly post: GDP Release - Weekly post (22-26/Dec) [FREE post]AlmaÂ·December 20, 2025Read full storyShort-term sentiment is still â€œgood news are not too bad newsâ€ almost neutral.The past few days the market was heavily manipulated via ICs on a thin tape.In the following days we will see if the sentiment has actually shifted and market is ok with the GDP, or they need to reprice the easing cycle expectationsâ€¦In the wednesday post I wrote:â€The dice are loadedYesterday the GDP and PCE datas came out how I expected: inflationary tendencies (re-accelerating actually) and â€˜GDP upâ€™, and deficit remains but it decreased a bit, while investment also decreased. Market indeed started to reprice Fed cut expectations.In the weekly post, I said, that the release will be an important sentiment-check on the mid-run. In the premarket post, I marked that it seems like, they want to hold the market up:1) on Monday close, the SPX/yields beta went up towards zero. It didnâ€™t go positive, but it flattened the market reaction;2) we had an IC 10x times the trade size of the average position sizes, that was set just right at pivots where long downside vol positions had convexities;These two in themselves dampened the initial market reaction that was a 15 pts sell in futures, and then forced algos to bid on delta right at the open.  In regards of the weekly post, this is a discrepancy of what the market expected for the week. This is where the edge lies, because:1) If the market behaves as it is expected, then it is an easy play, sentiment remains in check, volatility remains controlled, even if the expectations are negative;2) If the market moves more above the expectations, then the sentiment is out of control (more bearish/bullish), reinforcing the trend;3) If the market divergences from the initial expectations, thats the strongest signal, because that also means that the initial positioning must be shifted providing mechanical support too. However, the trend must be confirmed!Now, Friday will be the tell if the GDP reaction was an actual shift in sentiment (even if forced) or just the temporal product of IC and mechanical flows solely on a thin tape.SubscribeAfter all these, Trump posted: This post felt literally just like if he would have answered to my last two posts I dropped during the weekendâ€¦There are some small fibs about trade deficit, investments and inflation, but the core message aligns with my â€œBessent putâ€ thesis I just wrote about few days ago, that they are about to reshape the reaction function to the economy. And when the POTUS says something like this, you better take it serisouly!Trump claims that in good old days, markets were rallied on good news. Depends on what he meant by â€œold daysâ€: after the dotcom bubble, it was net true until 2020, however before 90s it was exactly the opposite. As long as core inflation remains above target, market doesnâ€™t like â€˜good newsâ€™â€¦ ot it should not doâ€¦However what Trump promises by this post is that they will rig the game even more fundamentaly in order to keep the markets up. UK and US both did something similar in the 70s, and also Turkey did so two years ago driving their economy into a hyperinflation. All of these ended up in forced tightenings after.Whatâ€™s the purpose? Well, if you get GDP up/prices up and policymakers still try to push easier conditions, the best case is a â€œfinancial repressionâ€ with lower real rates that erode the real burden of debt, but at the cost of higher inflation volatility and distortions.However there is a risk that long-end yields still rise, and so debt service can worsen. And this is were the Bessent-put comes into playâ€¦They expand long-end buyback operations and aim to keep vol low. But this will keep inflation sticky again. This tells me that Trump wants to bring back the post-WW2 â€œyield curve controlâ€ scheme later.The Fed implemented a form of yield-curve targeting, capping rates at multiple maturities (famously ~2.5% on long bonds). This made mortgages, corporate loans, and other investments cheaper, stimulating the economy.The market rallied like ~135% from 1942 to 1951 March, when they unwound this regime. Because once inflation pressures rise, holding down long yields can require balance-sheet expansion and/or regulation-like controls, which can undermine credibility and create an eventual break. Now, you can see a three-years long bearmarket started in 1946 May.This was because of sharp reflation after price controls were eliminated. As a result of YCC, bill yields pegged at 0.375% and the long bond capped at 2.5%, with the Fed having to buy securities to defend the structure if markets didnâ€™t want to hold them at those yields. Now, even if nominal yields were anchored, real yields could become sharply negative during the inflation spike, creating a noisy valuation environment.Later, as inflation expectations persisted, Fed went for tightening in 1948, and the economy entered its first postwar recession in Nov of 1948, and then the cycle reset. We have however this AI-boom too, that is supportive only if the developments deliver real productivity, shifting the environment towards positive supply-side shock. But the risk is high that the AI is demand today but wonâ€™t become a supply tomorrow. Debt/GDP could look better in nominal terms, but productivity would be lower and capital allocation would degrade. And this would produce a very similar or â€œrhymingâ€ pattern of what happened in the last century. On the short-runThis will hold up the markets artificially and win the mid-term elections at any cost.The game is rigged, I donâ€™t consider it as a good investing environment into risk assets, nor for longer-term trades. Iâ€™m scaling out of some longer-term positions, took profit from Nov 20 longs, and will take new ones only if a pullback happens, potentially around spring. In my â€œplaying the AI bubble postâ€ I marked 8k+ target as max for the cycle under Trump. I will refresh this post soon. As the market is rigged, I do not play any downside, as I keep emphatizing. When I see risk, I hedge volatility solely, not spot direction. I use the dips to take long positions, but I see no edge in shorting, not because it canâ€™t go down, but because the market is heavily manipulated towards teh upside until reality hits. But not nowâ€¦â€ SubscribeLetâ€™s see what opportunities we have for todayâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisSentiment has shaken - Weekly post (17-21/Nov)Nov 16, 2025âˆ™ Paid229ShareUpdated Window of Risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update AlmaÂ·October 29, 2025Read full storyMarket has finally seriously shaken, but structure has not broken. It was tested but market held the marked lower bound at 6650.13 The reason I say â€˜seriously shakenâ€™ is that the sell wasnâ€™t the cause of mechanical flows but strictly sentiment-driven. As I keep warning you over the past 2 weeks, market has a lot of mispriced risk, plus the adminâ€™s position is also challenged: 1) as I showed you, the AI/tech sector has significant misvaluations and faces supply-chain risk; 2) Trumpâ€™s position is weakening he is losing leverage against the â€˜deep stateâ€™ and against his foreign opponents.Based on some intels, I estimate serious troubles for him into next Q1, late February-March period, and market will feel it, because all what happened since April was built on the faked reality that the admin projected, and that the public trusts less and less nowâ€¦ this is the key! This is a big sentiment pivot.I donâ€™t expect bear market, but that period is my next window of risk target, after this current one. SubscribeThe risk/liquidity proxy asset, Bitcoin also broke my marked 107k pivot, and most likely heading towards my marked downside targets. In my July post, I predicted topping into August and volatility after October. VoilÃ¡, it is happeningâ€¦ targets are still the same. Structurally, it should rebound now back towards 112-115k and lose structure there to confirm downward move for the coming months. This coming week is risk heavy: first, we have OpEx, but before that we have VIX expiration, NVDA earnings and NFP release. Me personally, Iâ€™m not into shorting this now, at least not until NVDA ER, the guide matters as it can amplify the depreciation/ROI concerns.My personal short-term strat is rather building long positions into Dec rally (potentially triggered by further Fed cut), with primarly not expecting new ATHs.My bias for a Santa rally is intact yet. The more lower the market is let to go, the better and more stable the rally will be. But from now, every rally will be considered very fragile. Market is starting to wake up from an euphoria, and will realize that it has outrun itself. It is a house of cards. The trust is shaken, looking for the reality. Trump wants to avoid blackswan (I think he will), but his leverage is running out of ammo. Plus datas are back, and as I said, data is very risky nowâ€¦SubscribeLetâ€™s see, what can we expect from OpEx, and what levels, pivots and structure the positioning projects aheadâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# SEPTEMBER - Monthly & Weekly post (02-05/Sept)

> PMI, NFP, FOMC, OpEx, Monthly and weekly exposures

**Date:** unknown

Market analysisSEPTEMBER - Monthly & Weekly post (02-05/Sept)PMI, NFP, FOMC, OpEx, Monthly and weekly exposuresSep 01, 2025âˆ™ Paid301ShareAs you know, my risk target is the second half of September given the hawkish cut scenario on 17/Sept. The cut will unlock some of the MMF money, but it wonâ€™t provide instant support for the market. The guidance is expected to be hawkish, simply because it is based on labour market weakness and to keep the momentum in growth, rather than disinflation. However, as I keep explaining Trump decided to manage debt burden over inflation. Market knew that Trumpâ€™s term will be inflationary. When the derisking finally happens, I will buy the dip heavily for the long-run (into the next 2-3 years). Now, letâ€™s look at what tone the monthly exposure sets for the shorter tenors, then I will scrutinize what is the marketâ€™s expectation for the next week. MONTHLY EXPOSURECoding monthly positioning: This is a net short delta, short vega, long theta positioning, withshort vomma, long veta, long vanna and short charm. So, the market is pricing in a leptokurtic, negatively skewed distribution. This means, vol is muted until OpEx, however it is weakening, and after that the short vomma will expand vol moves. The vanna profile is steeper to the downside below 6461.83, and we have a 6.39% increase in 5-delta put skew during the last week, and a 9.79% increase in the 22-delta skew! The volatility market prices a 143.86 pts range to the upside and a 208.97 range to the downside on a monthly basis. Based on volatility distribution, this takes me to the 6557.93 - 6604.11 range to the upside and to the 6251.27 - 6318.35 range to the downside. What does it all mean? Quantitatively firstâ€¦Above 6469.51 the market will face more vol selling, with heavy pivot at 6505/6519.75, from where the position becomes steep right-tailish, but based on vol market, 6557.93 is the main target, however, because the exposure is short vomma, we have a margin of error of 6604.11 into the month end. Simultanously they hedge a heavy left-tail, but vacuum-down wonâ€™t take effect if 6214.22 is held, and based on vomma, market expects 6318.35 a primal downside target and 6251.27 as a margin of error. The interesting part is that this derived expected area has a geometric mean just 6.14 pts higher than the vol adjusted mean of my reversion algo at 6278.57However if volatility goes out of control and skew shows strenght at 6214.22, the vacuum-down effect of the left-tail comes, and can easily take the market down to 6067.08; here participants should realize there hedges heavily, if not, vanna shows 5870 as the max. This is a very heavy left-tail scenario, market doesnâ€™t shows this much of fear right-now. Both tail-skew and 22d skew is up significantly due to the expected hawkish cut and repricing, but not that much. They donâ€™t expect any extra malign surprise. For first, they expect vol supply until Sept OpEx. To grasp the monthly sentiment more nuanced, letâ€™s look at the OpEx exposure too (vol adjusted): Gamma only: First thing we should recognize is that vanna is net positive while speed is net negative, but both exposures are relatively flat, and vomma remains bid in this tenor as well. This is because, even tho customers buy less downside gamma relative to upside gamma, the vol risk premium is higher on them. The tail-skew is up by 8.21% and the 22-delta skew by 18.06% in this tenor, during the past week. This is significant. This is like expecting to hit 6165.87 on a hawkish Fed guidance after the cut. They expect that the downside volatility would ignite in the 6322.39 - 6366.64 range, keep this in mind, when you hedge. This line will test the skew. And this is what the vomma is also showing us. To the upside, they expect a 6532.63 - 6566.64 range as max, with volatility suppressed to 8.25% (currently at 9.46%). The monthly betSo, on a monthly basis, the participants are pricing a negative skewed distribution, with increasing kurtosis. We have a small right-tail, but an even fatter left-tail, especially into FOMC due to volatility.What market expects is, that volatility remains supplied/stairstep up, but this dampening effect is fading into the OpEx week, until they expect the market to range (follow weekly posts) in an expanded range, then they expect volatility squeeze on FOMC (similarly to 2024 Dec FOMC), then OpEx will provide some slowdown/downside support (due to the negative speed profile), Monday some delta buyback, and then further sell-off, but on a slowed manner, and Trump is expected to bail out the sentiment.The pivotal tenor for volatility is this coming week, where market prices a platykurtic, positively skewed distribution.  The reversion model shows probability for reversion around 84.15%, this is significant, and not unexpected after the 91.27% signal on 13/Aug, where I also warned, that during three times in the past (2018; 2021 and 2024) this high signal occured 1-month before the momentum shift, or 90 pts before the high (2024 July gamma squeeze).  Adjust your put spreads and put flies accordingly.The downside target that it says is 6278.57 - as mentioned above: In order to keep the positive imbalance, market should produce a 6450.61 monthly avg price, otherwise it goes toward equilibrium. Not a coincidence that the body of the distribution is there.As you know, Iâ€™m bullish for Trump term as dollar is crushed and market is heavily stimulated and Trump is about to manage debt burden over inflation. When the pullback happens and derisks the market, I will buy the dip heavily.Keep this post in mind: Playing the AI-Bubble; Long-term outlook AlmaÂ·July 22, 2025Read full storyStochastic Volatility - Options market insights is a reader-supported publication.

Then shutdown occuredâ€¦U.S. equity funds took in $36.4B over the past week (largest since Nov â€™24), heavily into large-caps; small/mid saw outflows; short-to-intermediate Treasury funds saw large outflows. Risk-onâ€”at least in cap-weighted beta, short are being squeezed. Macro is supported now.Shutdown dominates near-term focus, historically shutdowns rarely derail rallies. Earnings next.The big-cap inflow keeps broad beta supported even with thin macro dataâ€”until earnings or a prolonged shutdown re-prices things. Dispersion-friendly structures (single-name vs index) and defined-risk downside (put spreads) into any shutdown headline shock. SubscribeI also want to citate my Thursday post here about GLD rallyâ€¦â€œFor portfolio managers:The current gold rally is chiefly supported by central banks + ETF demand, and (statistically) that rates lead gold, not ETF flows or the dollar. The Fedâ€™s easing bias and upside risk to breakevens are the bullish pillars.Gold is effectively short beta to real yields, so the biggest left-tail is a real-yield backup / curve steepenerâ€”thatâ€™s what we should hedge.Gold doesnâ€™t produce cash flow and is prone to regime swings. Itâ€™s a hedge/insurance, not a compounding engine. So, treat gold as exposure to inflation/real-rate factors rather than an â€œasset class.â€ Size it by risk budget and factor diversification, not notional. Manage the overlap with duration/ breakeven risk in the rest of the portfolio, so you donâ€™t double up on the same macro bet.Measure your portfolioâ€™s gold to real-rate beta: regress Î”gold vs Î”10y TIPS yield and vs Î”breakeven; update rolling. Adjust rates-up hedges to the beta. TY/US put spreads (short 10y/long-bond futures via puts) sized by DV01 to your estimated goldâ€“rates beta (mind vol risk!). Or bear-steepener options (2s10s/5s30s payer spreads) to cover a potential curve-steepening riskâ€¦ GLD/XAU puts or collars (e.g., 3â€“6M 25Î” put financed with a 10â€“15Î” call sale) to protect against ETF-inflow stall/reversal. Because downside is on the table if ETF inflows stop.Or if youâ€™re not set up to manage rate hedges, consider simpler collars or a multi-asset inflation sleeve (gold + TIPS + commodities) to diversify the bet.â€ SubscribeNow, letâ€™s analyse what the current weekly positioning impliesâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Short weekly post, The coming challenges

**Date:** unknown
**Source:** https://stochvoltrader.substack.com/p/short-weekly-post-the-coming-challenges

---

Market analysisShort weekly post, The coming challengesBearmarket rally? May 26, 2025âˆ™ Paid4424ShareVery important macro eventsâ€¦April 2025 delivered a $258 billion surplus, driven by tax-season receipts, even as the FY-to-date deficit climbed to about $1.1 trillionM2 money stock surged to $21.8 trillion by end-March and rose roughly $300 billion in April, underscoring ample liquidity despite Fed tightening. 5-year breakeven inflation sat at 2.42 % on May 22 and drifted only Â±1 bp over the prior week, signaling anchored inflation expectations. Fed-funds futures (per CME FedWatch) assign only ~29 % odds to a rate cut at the June 18 FOMCâ€”markets see no change as the base case through summer. The Treasury is offering dealers an easy outlet to offload old 2-, 5- and 7-year notes, 2-year floatingâ€rate paper and bills today (and 20yâ€“30y bonds Thursday). Think of it as scheduled injections of liquidity at both ends of the curve. Friday is the first day when anyone still holding frontâ€month 10-year futures (ZN) must either deliver or roll into the next contract. With ~40 % of positions already rolled, thereâ€™s a thinning of liquidity in the front contractâ€”and that always stirs up basis swings and spikes in futuresâ€™ vol.These are mechanical supply/demand events: dealers buybacks absorb paper (dampening yield moves) while the FND roll sucks up futures liquidity (stoking basisâ€ and impliedâ€vol pops).  Bessent argues that small/community banks are hamstrung by one-size-fits-all capital/reg frameworks and regulators who â€œdonâ€™t care about growth.â€ His point: if that agenda (Basel relief, lighter capital charges on Treasuries, easier ag-lending) moves forward, it would turbocharge bank lending and reduce short-term funding strains. Deregulation would relieve the â€œdash for cashâ€ (negative swap spreads, widening CDS) by letting banks lend more freely and hoard less high-quality collateralâ€”taking tail-risk off the table. Whether the 90-day U.S./China pause holds (or snaps back into full-blown 25â€“30% levies) is the binary that will decide if the Fed/investors lean into that deregulation lifeline or throw up their hands and price in renewed stagflation. So basically the weekâ€™s mechanical liquidity injections in cash Treasuries set the stage for calmer yields, only to be punctuated by futures-driven basis squeezes on FND that rippled through volatility markets. SubscribeSPX is bumping up against a resistance ceiling (coding at 5871.44 for SPX and 5885.79 for ES)â€”and that only two catalysts can drive a decisive breakout above it this week: economic data (e.g. GDP revisions or PCE on May 29â€“30) or Nvidiaâ€™s earnings on May 28. Absent one of those triggers, the index is likely to stall again at the top of its range.A deeper-than-expected contraction (April GDP â€“0.3 % annualized) could pull the index lower, while an upside surprise might lift it through resistance, but not a too high beat. Staying within the expectations is healty. Core PCE is expected to ease modestly toward 2.3 % y/y; a significant miss on the downside could embolden the Fed-pause narrative, lifting stocks, whereas stickier prints could reinforce caution.Also options markets price in a Â±7 % move in NVDA on earnings, and given its weight in the SPX (~8.5 %) and SOXX, a strong NVDA print could provide the gamma squeeze needed to push the index back towards 5900.Now listen,The Treasuryâ€™s liquidity-support buybacks for short (2s, 5s, 7s, FRNs, bills) and long (20â€“30 yr) maturities give dealers a pre-scheduled outlet to offload off-the-run bonds, which caps sharp yield moves and in turn limits equity pullbacks around those dates. I code 5776.23 for SPX and 5796.33 for ES as pivots momentum-wise).We can see this in SPX/LTY correlation, it tanked steepely. Equity risk appetite tends to recover, compressing VIX and another volatility measures.Short-End Buybacks (Tue) and Long-End Buybacks (Thu) create dampened volatility initially. Futures First Notice Day (Fri) thins the front-month 10-yr futures (â€œZNâ€), sparking basis squeezes and spikes in VIX/VXST.

Global growth will slow only slightly this year and next. The AI optimism, tight credit spreads, earlier USD slide easing USD borrowersâ€™ strains, tariff shock being smaller than feared for now, and private sector adaptability are all supportive on the short-run.However, equity prices are approaching late-1990s dot-com levels (in terms of sigma) and so a sharp correction would tighten financial conditions and hit growth, especially in developing economies. Plus monetary gold now exceeds one-fifth of official reserves (the central-bank bid narrative thatâ€™s supported this yearâ€™s rally- as I predicted in April), and the risk of margin compression that could flip to consumer passthrough, rekindling inflation is still looming. Tight spreads are part of why conditions feel easy. The implied risk is gap-risk if equities correct. That tilts institutional credit positioning toward higher-quality carry, shorter spread duration, and systematic hedges (index puts/CDX) into event windows. â€™Buffett indicatorâ€™ (total market cap vs GDP) shows 221.54% today. It is very out of reality. The current situation favors more dispersion in equities. Uncertainity is unusually high, while global debt is marching above 100% of GDP during the next 4 years window. If US tackles the structural federal deficit and incentivize household saving (e.g., retirement tax preferences), that is supportive on the long-run. SubscribeWith the USD stalling, flows are gravitating to EM and carry. The U.S. data blackout keeps uncertainty high; when Washington reopens, they expect softer momentum in the macro tape, which could cap further USD gains.France is in flux after PM SÃ©bastien Lecornu resigned; Macron is set to name a new PM within ~48 hours. Importantly, snap elections look less likely than they did earlier in the week. The euro broke its 100-day and momentum accounts had to adjust. We should consider trimming shorts near 1.1580/50, but stay medium-term USD-bearish and open to flipping later.USD/JPY move looks overextended absent fresh data. The LDP elected Sanae Takaichi, prompting a JPY slide as markets priced easier fiscal stances; large banks also cooled on near-term JPY longs. 155 would be a danger zone for Japanâ€™s MoF (intervention risk), and flag near levels: minor resistance 153.70/80, bigger at 154.90/00; support 151.20/30. Cross-JPY (e.g. CHFJPY, EURJPY) still pushing highs.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Statistical-arbitrage: Mean Reversion Trading

Educational postsStatistical-arbitrage: Mean Reversion TradingCourse: Cointegration, ADF, CADF, Johansen-test, Risk managementOct 24, 2025âˆ™ Paid2722ShareIn the following educational post, I will examine mean-reversion trading. I will introduce cointegration, the Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test, the Johansen test, the mathematics of half-life, and my own method for incorporating the realised distribution (skewness and kurtosis).I will explain the principles of risk-management strategies and show practical techniques for applying this highly creative market-maker strategy.Finally, I will touch on the core idea and mathematical approach of a cross-sectional long/short strategy. An in-depth course for tradersâ€¦SubscribeINTRODUCTIONIn my most recent educational post, I explained how, over the long run, most retail traders end up with a negative expected value. Alongside pricing, costs and taxes, one of the most important drivers of this is the random movement of prices, which materially reduces the probability of accurate forecasting. Matters are complicated further by the fact that the very probability of being able to predict price moves also fluctuates over time.Market inefficiencies can be exploited by a trader only until they become widely known. Once they are, the edge disappears. A classic example was the January effect: toward year-end, investors and fund managers would sell their smaller-cap stocks, partly to optimise the look of their year-end reports and partly to realise losses to reduce their tax bills. That selling created pressure on small caps, which the big players then bought back after the forced sales. As this anomaly became more widely known, more traders started snapping up the small caps being dumped onto the market; the January effect largely vanished, and brokerage costs could swallow the entire profit.Price dynamics have several mathematical properties that sharply distinguish them from a pure random walk. These include heavy left tails and negative skewness in returns; volatility clustering; mean reversion and long memory in volatility; long-memory in order flow (stemming from order-splitting, while prices remain near-martingales because liquidity providers offset it); momentum and mean-reversion tendencies, and so onâ€”I have written about these before.Algorithms exploit such anomalies as well, so any edge is highly unstable. Bond-market prices, in particular, are literally unpredictable.As I noted in my last post, there are three things we can say with confidence: 1) time passes; 2) volatility mean reverts; and 3) over the long term, equity indices are very likely to rise (though I have already shown counter-examples). This favours long-term investors and volatility sellers.So how could one build a strategy with a positive expected value even in the long term?In the chart below you can see the SPXâ€™s deviation relative to its monthly average: This is not volatility, but it is very similar, since volatility measures the standard deviation of log returns over a given window. Yet, like volatility, it exhibits a well-defined mean-reversion property. Because of this, a misconception has taken hold among retail traders that deviations from the 21-day moving average reliably signal an overextension in the direction of market momentumâ€”something that can be exploited with various â€˜fade-the-moveâ€™ strategies.At first glance the chart would seem to bear this out; the problem is that the moving average itself is continually moving. And that overlooks the role of time correction: the longer the market spends at a given level, the more the moving average will converge on that level. Thatâ€™s high-school mathematics. Thus the moving average can move towards spot, and spot can move towards the moving average; on the chart above, the two will look identical. That gives an edge to volatility mean-reversion trades, but for spot traders it poses the same question yet again.The problem is unchanged: the average movesâ€”and it can move either up or down. What we would want is an â€˜averageâ€™ like volatility has, something that is roughly estimable. The problem is the uncertainty of direction. Now, spot has no such thingâ€¦ but we are able to generate one ourselvesâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

This is why, the it is not visible directly in the index. The rotation is concentrated mostly in NDX. As the first cracks of the bubble are already visible, trust in capex spending decreases, tech is up on speculative flows only. Free research-post about it soon.CTA, VC positionins remain asymmtric to the downside, but market is ready to swallow the momentums, as you will see below. Geo risk is still there, Iran tension will grow. Key date to watch on the short-run is Feb 26, when the negotiations continues in Genf. The market is buying calls on oil, and heavily hedging higher risk premium, as Iran-risk spikes, but I donâ€™t expect any serious worsening until March OpEx week. That week is more risky. I donâ€™t see this conflict to be solved any other way than military conflict. As much as I can tell, it is inevitable. Russia, China and Iran are only playing for time. Because, time is against Trump.Trump tariffsThe Supreme Courtâ€™s decision did not address the practical consequences of the tariffs, it was limited strictly to the legal basis. This is important. As I wrote earlier in Jan, the Trump administration can maintain the bulk of these tariffs on a different legal foundation and will indeed keep them in place â€” only under a different legal justification.This is supportive in the short term, but it does not remove the uncertainty surrounding near-term inflationary risks.In my view, I do not expect any rate cuts until June or September. You will see below, that even tho, market structure looks weak as long as it remains under 6950.77, and ES below 6977 And even tho, there is a huge thin-liquidity gap below the November lows down to May 9 levels, market doesnâ€˜t expect the structure to be broken at all. Also note, that the 3-years moving average is at that May 9 gap level now, creating and even stronger structural downside support.It expects strong liqudity at December lows, and even more support and snapback at November lows in the worst case. While it looks sceptical about new ATHs in the near-term. See below. Watch ES 6855 for downside move confirmation. Below 6977, pressure on structure to the downside remains.

Market analysisSum, and bias... Intraday post (09/May), Bear market? Balance? May 09, 2025âˆ™ Paid155ShareNow that weâ€™re beyond the 20-day window during which the market hit the level (last year Aprilâ€™s lows) below which I had anticipated volatility selling and consolidation, realized volatility fell from 42.29% to 27.67%. As many of you know, Iâ€™ve found an edge on the short-volatility side since April 12 and was heavily short VIX (signaled in real time in the chat room), and hinted long delta, short vega on April 7 bottom day, with less confidence, short side was owned realtime in the chatroom.As mentioned earlier, the â€œvol-downâ€ scenario has serious implications. Risk-parity funds and CTAs and vol controls re-increase their exposure to the index, while other shorts are squeezed out. Also, the declining VIX has provided a vanna tailwind, as predicted.Another significant implication is that, with lower volatility, the derivatives markets can again exert a stronger effect on index momentums which consequently become less sensitive to headlines, monitored by algos, making it less risky to determine entry and exit points. The path forward is becoming clearer. After the April chaos, the market is finally digesting risks and information more efficiently, and we can see the end of the woods (market-wise). A very important sign of this is Abu Dhabiâ€™s IHC teaming up with BlackRock (and Lunate) to launch a $1 billion AI-driven reinsurance platform headquartered in the ADGM. This collaboration provides a serious tailwind for US markets and is naturally expected to cap volatility in the near future, signaling that investor confidence might be returning.Youâ€™re probably expecting me to say â€œhoweverâ€ soonâ€¦ and youâ€™re right, dear readerâ€”but no worriesâ€¦Speaking about local spot and dynamics, we should recognize that the vol selling that happened just after the tariffs shock was purely speculative and not rational, investor-driven. This is very important from momentum perspective, because this means the balance is getting skewed toward a crowded short-vol trade now. The market needs to rebalance this in order to reprice its vol expectations, taking into account the skipped future rate cuts and midsummer liquidity-crisis risk. The liquidity crisis can be managed by effective government diplomacy if partnerships unfold and China folds. In this case, the bear market will be skipped (the odds are roughly 51â€“49% that it will be skipped now; itâ€™s up to you whether to bet on this or not).One thing is certain. Despite the seemingly stabilizing spot at this point, we can see the VIX skew catching a bidâ€”even above its post-April Opex levels on the 22- and 5-delta strikes into May 13 expo.May 20 expo is way moderated, but 5 delta calls are trading at the IV of April 8 levels, while 22 delta strikes are stagnant.  This foreshadows a rebalancing movement coming soon in the very near-term (signaled yesterday first), basically part of a wider timeframe range-bound period, to stabilize its support and continue grinding higher with more confidence and less FOMO speculation.We caught the move, I signaled short realtime in the chatroom and so was shorted the last Friday high catching the move down to 5586 SPX.If SPX can make it below 5624.22 and rejects it from below, we can see a healthy pullback back to 5539-5517 zone. This will be coded during the weekend, if this even doesnâ€™t unfold today (I doubt it, but be adaptive). But this zone still falls into the margin of the weekly range:May 13-14 window is the risky window, then I expect supportive OpEx flows. The post-OpEx hedge unwind is uncertain, because I need more datas to model how much gammas are expected to be rolled into the next window. But the main bias is rebalancing before the stable grind up into summer happens. Ultimate green-light would be the benign deals as said above.

# Tail wags the dog, or...? July sentiment manipulation + Intraday post (27/June)

> Weekly post

**Date:** unknown
**Source:** https://stochvoltrader.substack.com/p/tail-wags-the-dog-or-july-sentiment

Market analysisTail wags the dog, or...? July sentiment manipulation + Intraday post (27/June)Jun 27, 2025âˆ™ Paid182ShareWeekly postRevised-weekly post on dynamics and FedLooming Fed pivotTail wags the dog, or dog wags the tail, or these are both the same as Jung would have say? After you done read the above linked posts, I want to emphatize that we are still in a net short vanna regime, but way flatter than before. The tenors are different. This week is characterized by vol selling as predicted (I only underestimated the effect of geo risk unwound, and vol actually made lower lows, after spot broke out of the range). Vomma supply remains on the monthly tenor, but on the shorter-tenors the bet is a VIX vega up, potentially expecting an SPX squeeze up into July 4, and that would push the dealer positions through the center of the long fly in VIX, and flatten further the SPX short vanna flow, that is still being materialized. Overall vomma selling seems remain with us into July. And vol can slowly start to catch a bid that would start to have a suppressive effect on the index, if VIX holds firmly below 16.5, but wouldnâ€™t really fall, only ranging, bcs the short speed profiles below act like a stunt mats towards any downside move. The key point is sentiment. That is artificially held up on dovish hopes. Both Fed, Bessent and algos made market taking bad news as good news. To fully understand this, you have to remember what Iâ€™m always telling you: when you listen to the news, always ask the question â€œwhy now, what do they want to sell me?â€, bcs on the Street sentiment is also literally a product. Always watch the timing first, not the content. Content only matters in the context. Read about the terms of â€˜reflexive controlâ€™. And the other thing is, that the whole system is just numbers going up and down. There are dynamic correlations (positive/negative) between different metrics etc. that algos are constantly monitoring (especially the trend of the changes!!) and so they trade based on it. So, this way, the tail starts to wag the dog, while the dog also wags the tail. A reflexive, self-fulfilling system. And a strong hand from the outside, like Bessent, can add other trends, values to this machine, that shifts the algo sentiment a bit. (I keep talking about the â€˜hidden QEâ€™ since April 13th, since SPX was at 5363.35). The reason for this sentiment manipulation is that they know that tariff effects ad other supply chain problems that I painted for you in April, are about to come, and will slowdown growth. Not necessary recession, 40-45% I assume only, but a strong, persistent stagflation. But Trump is about to pump growth for any price, as much as he can until reality starts to loom in. This is expected into July FOMC, and August (something that I first wrote about in April 24th). In April, I spent a lot of time to explain these processes for you very detailed. Check them back. So, sentiment is prepared to take recessionary datas positively. Pricing in a dovish tilt into July FOMC. Then I expect SPX/yields beta going back to positive, and a selling flow, on a â€˜no-cutâ€™ scenario. Odds are significantly high on this. (no vol squeeze, but a coordinated selling flow). Why?Because big money is on the sideline. Money-market funds now hold $7 trillion in assets, the most ever. With yields so attractive, institutional cash (MMFs, pension funds) has frozen in these shortâ€dated instruments rather than flowing into stocks. That creates an illiquid market for equities, with heavy supply on the sidelines. If the Fed would actually cut rates, t-bill yields would fall, making money funds less attractive, triggering an outflow from MMFs into equitites. If no-cuts happen, dollar would strenghten and we would see a slow, coordinated sell. This is a pivotal event if we are in a bear market or not. Remember the stagflation rally of the 70s... If GDP, PMI, payroll etc are weak enough, the market bet can be fullfilled.Until we can expect a net rangebounding basically accumulating zomma and vomma risk into August, while and vol spike will be managed through vol of vol supply, and if regime canâ€™t shift, bcs July 8-9 pushes SPX back after a potential squeeze up out of short vanna regime (as I expect), then vol grind up can start, slowly (in a stairstep manner).

# Tariff war, Bipolar World, Recession, Weekly post (31th march - 4th April)

Market analysisTariff war, Bipolar World, Recession, Weekly post (31th march - 4th April)Geos, Tariffs, Politics, Volatility, Underpriced left-tailMar 30, 2025âˆ™ Paid46138ShareIn this post, I will explain the relationship between the EU and the US in the context of the tariff war, and what risks the transforming world order is facing. From this, you will also understand the direct and indirect impacts all of this has on the markets.It is important to grasp the underlying mechanisms, because the market reacts to them. Take the time to go through it. Unfortunately, many people do not understand these things Iâ€™m writing about. They donâ€™t talk about themBefore we look at how the market is pricing itself for the week, there are two important things to mention. The first is the worldwide geopolitical realignment. This is very significant, because the economic framework weâ€™ve known until now is changing fundamentally, and in this context, all sorts of market trends make sense. The second is the impact of the JPM collar.Geopolitics again...I previously described the scenario intended to lay the groundwork for the modern â€œHoly Alliance,â€ so that peace may be achieved between the U.S. and Russia. Its foundation is ideological.I also mentioned that this realignment has ideological roots. Liberalism in the West has degenerated into a kind of self-serving hedonism, which, lacking a guiding ideology, inevitably leads to a collapse of the system over time. On the other hand, left-liberal political forces have monopolized the concept of democracy, and people have forgotten that democracy can exist within a right-wing conservative system as well. In fact, in history, the only functioning democracy was based on strongly ideological and conservative foundations.The core of any political ideology is what it believes about human nature. This is the basis on which we distinguish the left from the right. On the left, the individual is at the center, and everything elseâ€”nation, religion, institutions, etc.â€”exists to serve the individual. On the right, the individual is also central, but here the individual submits to those preceding and outliving them (nation, religion, ethics, etc.).The far-right extreme is nationalism, and the far-left extreme is communism. Since theyâ€™re extremes, both create total systems, but their ideological core on the wings is the same, so when the conflict between political ideologies becomes sharper, the right and the left donâ€™t cooperate with each other; rather, they gravitate toward the far right or far left, forming alliances there.Thatâ€™s why we see the shift among the Republican U.S., Russia, and right-wing European states toward the Arabs and other nationalist states, and among the Democratic U.S. and globalist European countries toward communist China and its allies.This transformation isnâ€™t yet obvious, but itâ€™s visible, and itâ€™s crucial to understand it in order to make sense of current events and future movements.Re-bipolarization, economics re-structurizationTrumpâ€™s tariffs are intended to force the EU to the negotiating table, compelling it to accept the U.S.â€“Russiaâ€“Middle East peace proposal. The globalist elite rejects this, since it would lead, among other things, to bleeding out the global capitalist systems, meaning they need to look for new allies and sources.In the charts below, you can see that after the first Trump administration (and the tariff war), a diversification trend began, in which both the EU and the U.S. started to increase the number of supplier countries for strategic products.The EUâ€™s diversification aimed to reduce dependence on Russia, while imports from China grew. The U.S., on the other hand, aimed primarily at independence from China but also from Russia. However, this comes with increased costs. In the first months of 2025, the Trump administration enacted several significant tariffs that directly hit European exports:On March 12, 2025, tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 25% on imported aluminum took effect, applying globally with no country exemptions. The official justification was national security: the U.S. argued that reliance on foreign metals threatened its industrial base, a claim made under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. European officials criticized this rationale, noting it â€œdisregard[s] the national security imperatives of the United States â€“ and indeed international securityâ€ when used as a pretext for protectionism. The EU had actually suspended its prior counter-tariffs on U.S. steel/aluminum during negotiations in 2023, but reactivated plans to retaliate once these new 2025 metals tariffs hit.On March 26, 2025, President Trump announced a sweeping 25% tariff on all imported automobiles (passenger cars and SUVs) and automotive parts. This import tax on cars, scheduled to begin April 3, 2025, is expected to affect major European automakers (Germany, France, Italy, etc.) which count the U.S. as a key market. The White House estimated the auto tariff could raise about $100 billion annually in revenue. The official reasoning given was economic: to foster U.S. domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign auto imports. By making imported cars 25% more expensive, the administration aims to push production and supply chains back to American soil (though industry experts warn it will also raise prices for consumers and disrupt supply lines for U.S.-based carmakers).In a more unconventional step, President Trump ordered a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil or gas from Venezuela in early 2025. This measure, leveraging the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), was ostensibly aimed at pressuring NicolÃ¡s Maduroâ€™s regime by penalizing its foreign customers. In practice, it swept up some EU countries (notably Spain and the Netherlands) which historically process Venezuelan crude. Those countries suddenly found all their exports to the U.S. taxed an extra 25% as long as they continued buying Venezuelan energy.By late March, new tariffs on lumber, microchips, pharma, and copper were planned for later in April, as part of a rolling pressure campaign, though specific rates were not yet implemented. These were justified as efforts to protect American industries deemed critical or to retaliate for what the U.S. views as unfair advantages enjoyed by foreign producers (for instance, the administration hinted at curbing semiconductor imports to press EU and Asian allies to align on tech policies).April tariffs: the goal is a ceasefire and to defeat stagflationThe administration signaled it would impose a flat, double-digit (20â€“25%) tariff on all imports from the European Union, aiming for a rate roughly matching the tariffs and barriers the EU applies to U.S. exports. This unprecedented moveâ€”treating the entire EU as a single target in a trade warâ€”was justified by the White House as enforcing â€œfair reciprocity,â€ arguing that Europeâ€™s own import tariffs (such as the EUâ€™s standard 10% tariff on cars, agricultural duties, and various non-tariff barriers like regulations) have disadvantaged U.S. exporters for years.As noted, the 25% auto tariff was announced in late March and set to take effect on April 3. By April, the impact on European carmakers was expected to be significant, with essentially all passenger vehicle exports to the U.S. facing a steep levy. Europeâ€™s auto industry is a major exporter (the EU shipped about â‚¬37 billion in cars to the U.S. in 2022), so this tariff directly hits a substantial flow of trade.Following steel, aluminum, and autos, the Trump trade team indicated that new tariffs on lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and possibly chemicals would be rolled out in phases throughout April. For instance, duties on imported microchips and drug products were on the agenda (impacting European tech and pharma firms). These measures were part of Trumpâ€™s strategy of incremental escalationâ€”using the threat of further pain to extract concessions in negotiations. By mid- to late April, however, the expectation in Europe was that no major industry would be spared if talks failed; the U.S. was prepared to tax a broad array of EU goods, effectively weaponizing Americaâ€™s entire import market as leverage.These tariffs come at a time when the European economy is already grappling with post-pandemic recovery and external shocks (like high energy prices stemming from the Ukraine conflict). Additional tariffs act like a tax on trade, potentially raising costs and prices (inflationary) while dampening demand (recessionary). The European Commission has voiced concerns that tit-for-tat tariff wars could â€œreignite global inflationâ€ and undercut growth. The EU must protect its economic interests and respond to U.S. trade aggression, but without hurting itself further.The Trump administration has justified its EU-directed tariffs as a necessary correction to perceived inequities (making the EU pay a price for its trade surplus and higher tariffs), a means to safeguard key U.S. industries and interests, and a leverage tool to negotiate better terms. But the key is that these tariffs are tools to force the EU to the negotiating table, compelling it to accept the upcoming â€œHoly Alliance 2.0â€ peace proposal. As I wrote, Trump needs to resolve this and eliminate Western stagflation by Easter. According to the original plans, a ceasefire should be in place by Q3.What can the EU do? In late 2023, the EU passed the Anti-Coercion Instrument, a new legal tool to respond to economic intimidation by non-EU countries. This was designed precisely for situations where a partner uses trade measures to coerce the EU or its members (the law was partly inspired by incidents such as Chinaâ€™s trade blockade of Lithuania). The ACI allows the EU to swiftly implement retaliatory measures beyond tariffsâ€”including restrictions on services, investments, or procurementâ€”if it determines that a foreign country is trying to coerce the EU. Trumpâ€™s blanket tariffs and explicit bargaining approach (â€œdo X or face tariffsâ€) could well be deemed economic coercion under the ACIâ€™s definition. For example, under the ACI, the EU could ban U.S. companies from participating in certain EU public tenders or restrict exports of critical EU goods to the U.S., as a targeted response.The EU can coordinate its response with other nations also targeted by U.S. tariffs. In 2025, the Trump tariffs are hitting allies like China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, BRICS, and others simultaneously. For instance, the EU, Canada, and Mexico could jointly refuse to negotiate under tariff blackmail and perhaps collectively threaten action through forums like the G7 or G20.The EU can challenge the U.S. tariffs through the World Trade Organizationâ€™s dispute mechanism. In fact, after the 2018 steel tariffs, the EU (and others) brought cases against the U.S. at the WTO. A formal legal challenge claims that the U.S. measures violate WTO rules (for example, the most-favored-nation principle and agreed tariff bindings). While the WTO process is slow and currently hampered (the Appellate Body is not fully functional due to U.S. blockages), pursuing a case still has value. It signals the EUâ€™s principled stance and might eventually authorize the EU to impose WTO-sanctioned counter-tariffs if it wins (essentially legal retaliation).Also, the European Central Bank can play a crucial role in buffering the EU economy against trade-war shocks. If U.S. tariffs begin to bite, the ECB could loosen monetary policyâ€”for instance, by delaying planned interest rate hikes or even cutting rates/stimulus if growth falters. By keeping credit cheap, the ECB would support European businesses through a rough patch and help counteract any rise in borrowing costs caused by market jitters. An ancillary effect of easier ECB policy is a weaker euro, which helps EU exporters compete internationally (partly offsetting U.S. tariffs, as a cheaper euro makes European goods less expensive in dollar terms). Indeed, in response to the tariffs and the â€œmoney goes homeâ€ capital shift, the euro has depreciated somewhatâ€”privately welcomed by EU officials as it boosts export competitiveness. They will let the exchange rate adjust naturally as a shock absorber. The ECB will also be ready to provide liquidity to financial markets if necessary (through asset purchases or swap lines) to prevent a credit crunch in Europe if U.S. actions cause severe market dislocation. Essentially, monetary policy is a tool to stabilize confidence: as the U.S. raises import barriers, the ECB can reassure firms that financing will remain available and that policymakers are supporting demand. This mitigates recession risk. (One must note, however, that the ECBâ€™s primary mandate is controlling inflation. If tariffs drive inflation up via higher import prices, the ECB faces a balancing act. Yet given the priority of maintaining growth and financial stability, it will likely err on the side of accommodation, as President Lagarde has indicated openness to looking through one-off price impacts in favor of the broader outlook.)On the fiscal side, the EU (and member state governments) can deploy spending and subsidies to blunt the tariffsâ€™ impact. The European Commission could temporarily relax its strict budget rules, allowing member countries to run slightly higher deficits to fund relief measures.In an extreme scenario where capital flight from the EU becomes destabilizing (for instance, if U.S. companies begin divesting en masse or if the dollar soars in value at the euroâ€™s expense), the EU could consider measures to manage these flows. Full capital controls are unlikely in a free-market EU, but heightened investment screening might prevent opportunistic takeovers of strategic European firms if their valuations drop. EU regulators could also coordinate to discourage hasty withdrawalsâ€”for example, by diplomatically urging U.S. multinational companies not to cut and run from European operations, or by highlighting the long-term costs of leaving. The EU could seek support from other global investors (such as sovereign wealth funds from friendly countries) to step in and invest in Europe, offsetting any U.S. pullout. The key is to ensure that if â€œsome money goes homeâ€ to America, other money comes into Europe from elsewhere. By maintaining an attractive investment climateâ€”i.e., not retaliating in ways that scare off all foreign investorsâ€”the EU can mitigate the financial impact.On the defensive side, the EU can adjust its import sources. Higher U.S. prices (whether due to tariffs or any EU response) mean Europe can replace some U.S. imports with domestic or alternative foreign suppliers. The EU had already implemented steel import safeguards in response to Trumpâ€™s steel tariffsâ€”basically limiting imports from elsewhere so that steel diverted from the U.S. would not flood Europe. It could tighten these quotas further to protect EU steelmakers who are now hurt on the other side by U.S. tariffs. For agricultural commodities, if the EU imposes countermeasures not as tariffs but rather as quotas or restrictions, it can manage supply. Additionally, reducing dependence on U.S. high-tech inputs (such as certain semiconductors or software) is already a strategic goal for Europe; the trade war merely reinforces the drive for tech sovereignty (e.g., investing in European chip fabs so that U.S. export restrictions or tariffs on chips are less harmful).On the offensive side, the EU could speed up negotiations on trade deals with willing partners. For example, finalizing pending EU trade agreements with countries like Australia, India, or the Mercosur bloc (Brazil/Argentina, etc.) could open new markets for European goods. If American protectionism closes one door, opening others is crucial.And the most important thing: China and the EU could directly strike at U.S. economic interests. U.S. Treasuries are viewed as the benchmark for global financial stability. If the EU sold off a significant portion of its holdings, it could depress bond prices and push up interest rates. This sudden shift could unsettle global financial markets, leading to higher volatility and elevated borrowing costsâ€”not only in the U.S. but worldwide. Thatâ€™s why we saw a small increase in CDS prices when the PCE figures came out: The timing is very telling. Look at how much it has risen in relative terms over the last few weeks.Such an aggressive move would definitely hit the EU as well, since it would destabilize global markets, and the EU canâ€™t reposition itself that quickly (and I doubt itâ€™s intended to). However, it is temporarily financing military resources and commodity stockpiles for its reserves.In a bipolar, fragmented world, commodity prices become far more sensitive to various external shocks than in a globally cooperative, integrated world. Furthermore, as countries migrate from one bloc to another, exchange rate dynamics change. Restricting free trade leads to a smaller economic surplus. I recommend reading the IMFâ€™s 2023 paper on re-polarization.Sell-off, bottomWhat weâ€™re seeing now is that despite Fridayâ€™s events, the market seems complacent. Itâ€™s not taking the trade war seriously, which is quietly and gradually unfolding under the hood. (I know many of you think this is just a theory, but once these events pass, youâ€™ll see in hindsight what really happened. Maybe Trump will explain it one dayâ€”though heâ€™s risking an American civil war with every move.)This could lead to a black swan scenario around tariffs. On the other hand, thereâ€™s the U.S.â€“Iran standoff, for which Trump needs Putin to help find a resolution. additional vol events ahead are ISM and NFP. And as I mentioned, a fragmented world economy fundamentally raises the average annual volatility. Market is not prepared. They donâ€™t see it.As I posted earlier, the biggest interest is in tech. Thatâ€™s were the selling is going on. As much as Iâ€™m allowed to say, the U.S. wants to buy out Chinaâ€™s stake in major tech interests like NVDAâ€”which faces significant China-related issuesâ€”and AAPL, where manufacturing is in China and AI progress is restricted by slower iPhone demand. Arabian funds donâ€™t give their money to China. MSFT is a major target to long later around Q3, partly due to its Dubai division, which they can then control. Insiders expect bottoming after Easter, into Q3. I would say, around last year April levels.JPM Collar expiryBefore we move on to the weekly skew, I need to mention the JPM Collar expiration on Monday. In last weekâ€™s weekly post, I already explained how the collar works in detail. Itâ€™s very important to understand this, because thereâ€™s a lot of misinformation about it on social media.The collar primarily affects the vega profile in the weeks leading up to expiration. Its impact is especially significant near the short call strike and below the long put strike at expiration, due to gamma.As I wrote, they let the collar expireâ€”they donâ€™t close it. Meanwhile, around 2 PM, they open a new collar, which they delta-neutralize with a 0DTE call to remove the extra synthetic short exposure the double collar would otherwise create during the final two hours.If the spot is above the long put strike (5565), there can be only a mild supportive effect. The OTM expiring put spread provides minor support, which the new collar largely absorbs. However, if the put spread expires ITM, then short vanna, long charm, and short speed create a suppressive environment toward the lower leg (4700), roughly towards 5114.24The collarâ€™s psychological impact is bigger than its actual influence on flows. And the funds know this, which is why they play with it.I caution everyone against overemphasizing dealer flow or any single effect. Dealer flow mostly has microstructural impacts. The macro picture is told by the marketâ€™s overall story, which places daily positioning changes and volatility cycles into context.Letâ€™s look at the skewâ€¦WEEKLY OUTLOOK/CONTEXTHere is the skew as it looks like now, into Q3Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Educational postsThe "Bessent put" - SPX/yields correlation; (Hidden QE)Dec 19, 2025âˆ™ Paid271ShareAfter calling the April selloff and the downside target in advance, I began writing more and more about a so-called â€˜hidden QEâ€™â€”which, by May, I started referring to as the â€˜Bessent putâ€™: a concealed support mechanism designed to sustain artificial growth, primarily via equityâ€“yield correlation dynamics. As someone who both trades tactically in the short term and manages a long-term investment portfolio, this metric is one of my most important gauges of market sentiment.SubscribeThis is because it tells you whether the market will decode the next data print as a growth shock or as a rates/financial-conditions shock. If Treasury market functioning (e.g., eSLR reform, clearing, buybacks/issuance) reduces rates tail risk, thenâ€”through pro-cyclical systematic flowsâ€”the system will more frequently settle on a â€˜supportiveâ€™ interpretation, lifting equities and reinforcing the wealth-effect channel.Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to write about briefly nowâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# The challenges of 2026

> Venezuela, US-CN, AI bubble, Geography, Inflation, Stagflation, Crisis

**Date:** unknown
**Source:** https://stochvoltrader.substack.com/p/the-challenges-of-2026

Market analysisThe challenges of 2026Venezuela, US-CN, AI bubble, Geography, Inflation, Stagflation, CrisisJan 05, 2026âˆ™ Paid4554ShareIn the post that follows, I have compiled the geopolitical, economic, and equity-market developments and challenges that have embedded significantâ€”yet still underpricedâ€”risk in the market. These dynamics are already underway and will continue to play out, as many have written and as an increasing number are now writing, and they will set the tone for the period ahead.In 2025, in addition to corporate earnings, the marketâ€™s main engines were valuation expansion and fiscal and monetary stimulus, so a buy-the-dip approach broadly generated net positive returns. However, a number of challenges and risks have accumulated for the year ahead.In 2026, we should expect real interest rates to rise as inflation expectations fall at an accelerating pace, creating a drag on growth. And if labour-market trends continue, the liquidity support from further rate cuts will not necessarily offset a weakening macro backdrop. I think there is a strong likelihood that the Fed will pause its rate-cutting cycle in the first quarter of 2026, and then resume easing in June after a new chair takes office. Given the cooling in employment and the fading pass-through from tariff effects, a moderate degree of monetary easing can be expected in 2026. In addition, if the dollar were to weaken excessively, the yen could strengthen enough on a relative basis to compress (and potentially unwind) carry-trade activity, which is already a key risk factor for this year.The global portfolios are under re-structuring. The fact that, relative to gold, the S&P 500 is down by 29.33%, while in euro terms it is up only 3%, is a very serious warning sign for the future. (I would add that, relative to gold, the European equity index has outperformed U.S. equities by 23%.) It is very important to analyze how U.S. equities and U.S. bonds are behaving relative to gold and relative to the euro area, because that relative-performance and cross-currency lens can uncover meaningful hidden capital flows and repositioning.This move is an important sign of capital flowing out of the U.S., which has led to a global reshuffling of portfolios and greater diversification, and this trend is expected to continue.If the dollarâ€™s purchasing power declines, beyond making imports more expensive and exports cheaper, it also means that the real value of claims denominated in fixed nominal amounts declinesâ€”even if their prices rise in nominal terms. Over the past year, long-duration U.S. Treasuries have generated a âˆ’33.33% return in gold terms.Record-low credit risk premia (tight credit spreads) suggest that expected equity returns will be low going forward.Corporate bond spreads have also tightened to record lows, which previously benefited both lower-quality bonds and equities, but by now there is not much room left for further spread compression. Overall, there is little scope for additional excess return from equity risk premia, credit spreads, and liquidity premia.And if Bessent fails to keep bond yields low and demand continues to weaken, yields may riseâ€”which, with todayâ€™s overvalued asset prices, could trigger a very deep correction, potentially even a bear market.SubscribeReversion model flags 6,889.84 as the level that must hold for the rally to extend. There is no excessive short-term momentum on the horizon.On a multi-year basis, however, the model shows a 92.81% probability of a mean reversion below 6,000. In backtests, I typically need 95%+ to call a high-conviction topping signal, but this reading already helps explain why investors are in â€œsell-into-strengthâ€ mode.(These signals appeared in 2019, 2020, 2022, and again in 2025 ahead of the April crash)The market, as it stands today, is no longer suitable for investment: rotation is underway, while significant stagflation, credit, geopolitical, and social risks are accumulating.The problems are far deeper and longer-term than many believe. As I wrote several times in March and April, the reshaping of the geopolitical structure as we have known it has begun; the United States must fight to preserve its hegemonic role while also solving the challenges of a changing global economic order. These struggles are intensifying.The market is currently dominated by hedge funds and private multi-billionaire speculators, such as Soros, who know how to pocket as much as possible from an inflating bubble and from rising vomma risk before the bubble bursts.The market favors momentum traders and speculators. The portfolio strategies that worked previously no longer protect you.In this post, I will outline the nature of the risks and challenges, including Venezuela, the U.S.â€“China conflict, the dangers of the AI boom and the risk of a credit crisis, stagflation risk, and demographic change.SubscribeGeopolitics - the hidden kurtosisLetâ€™s start with the most recent event: Venezuelaâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisThe looming risk, Bitcoin - Intraday post (11/Nov)AI, SCOTUS, BTC, Trump, China, tariffs, Iran - Uncertainity after uncertainityNov 11, 2025âˆ™ Paid121ShareUpdated window of risk: Window of Risk Pt. 2 - Flows update AlmaÂ·October 29, 2025Read full storyWeekly post: Geo and policy uncertainity is here - Weekly post (10-14/Nov)AlmaÂ·November 9, 2025Read full storyPlease take a look at this quoted tweet: Letâ€™s look at it closer: 1) CoreWeave beat Q3 revenue but trimmed 2025 guidance because a third-party data-center delay pushes deliveries/revenue to the right. Even with big top-line growth, profitability is getting pressuredâ€”higher accelerator costs, financing/interest expense, and the risk that depreciation overwhelms margins if revenue ramps slip. Banks have been warning that depreciation on massive AI capex (GPUs/servers) is underappreciated and will hit earnings as assets age faster than accounting lives. Barclays flagged this as a top risk for hyperscalers heading into 2025â€“26.2) Masayoshi Sonâ€™s SoftBank sold its entire Nvidia stake (~$5.8B) while pivoting capital toward other AI bets (OpenAI/â€œStargate,â€ Arm, etc.). Smart-money de-risking into peak euphoria.3) Iâ€™m focused on the Supreme Court case testing the administrationâ€™s use of emergency powers for broad tariffs. If admin loses, it would force a re-architecture of tariff policy through 2026, with messy refund litigation over previously collected tariffs and a scramble to design narrower, statute-clean trade tools. If the market has to re-price trade/inflation/earnings and a chaotic D.C. tape at once, we could see another April-type of crash. (Next year potentially)4) Treasuryâ€™s own trackers show gross federal debt â‰ˆ $38T in late Oct/early Nov. Also interest costs now surpass defense. CBO/IMF see big deficits and rising debt, close to 6â€“6Â½% of GDP, while BRICS is moving away from US treasuries. Market remains very headline sensitive as stated in the weekly post.Uncertainity is very high. Headlines are unpredictable. TACO doesnâ€™t save everything. A bigger market repricing is most likely in the window right after the US government reopens, when a backlog of official data finally hits (jobs, inflation, retail sales, etc.). That rush of information would land before the next FOMC meeting (Dec 9-10), forcing investors to quickly reset rate/path expectations. With missing data, officials are split on how soft the labor market/inflation really are; reporting has emphasized a â€œthickening data fogâ€ and a highly divided FOMC. I strongly think that the Fedâ€™s next move will look like a small cut with hawkish language, with a very split decision. SubscribeI see rebound around December, but I donâ€™t see correction is over.I took profit, and keep selling strenght.Also some of my intels hinted that Israel-Hamas and even Iran conflicts are not over. Market doesnâ€™t really price in any of these risks.BitcoinHere is the chart: BTC broke the structure I marked in my July 23 post (â€œPlaying the AI bubbleâ€).I mark 112-115k as the range it should reconquer to prove further uptrend. Datas donâ€™t look too good now. Iâ€™m patient with BTC, waiting for my buying target to play out. Not speculating. Iâ€™m not a buyer here. Digitalization of the stockmarket is going on. Cryptomarket will become stockmarket, see â€œVision2031â€, UAE is deliberately building the rails to integrate digital assets with capital markets (Web3)â€”via tokenization rules, on-chain issuance pilots, and a full virtual-assets regime.First digitally native bond on ADX (MENA first)â€”issued by First Abu Dhabi Bank on HSBC Orion; to list on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.

Market analysisThe problems, Momentum, Fed, Stagflation + Intraday post (11/July)Jul 11, 2025âˆ™ Paid1022ShareHere is my monthly and weekly post.And here is an educational post about trading principles. Next part is coming soonâ€¦And I also add, that the upward strenght is declining fast, while market breadth, put/call ratio and valuation metrics show extreme compliance. The problem is that the rally and markets at all-time-highs create leverage that will be used as collateral for more growth. This elevates household perceived net worth, creating positive wealth effect, that supports inflationary pressures even if underlying wages or incomes are unchanged.Meanwhile Trump, after extending the expiration dates of dozens of reciprocal tariffs into Aug 1, sent fresh tariff notifications to 23 countries, including Canada, Brazil, Japan and South Korea, detailing updated levies effective August 1.Donâ€™t forget that tariffs serve to give Trump leverage to negotiate. Fed is divided on when to cut rates due to the tariff uncertainity. Powell signaled a lower threshold for easing if tariff shocks prove temporary, but they still want to see more softening in core inflation and jobs data first. Until, rates stay with us. As I code, the rate is aligns with what the Taylor-rate would implicate especially taking into account the recession risk. Because GDP growth is expected to slowdown more into year end (weakest since 2009). Stagflation is there. However, market expects at least one cut by EoY. After Trump renewed tariff storm, the Fed Funds moved a bit up on current rate levels, and went down on lower rates, still expect a cut. Also SPX/yields beta is slightly negative, that means that people want bad news to get rate cuts. And this is a major divergence in the sentiment.A clear footprint of manipulation by Bessent, and the insider group behind Trump (banks, funds, JPM, BlackRock, private funds, etc.).When market finds equilibrium, it will reverse sharply.SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Please, re-read its section about the bond market, as it is crucial to understand for the coming weeks. Let me show you these two charts:andSwap spread is the fixed rate you receive in an interestâ€‘rate swap minus the yield on the corresponding Treasury (e.g. 30â€‘year swap rate minus 30â€‘year UST). When spreads turn negative, it means swap dealers are willing to pay fixed at a rate below what the U.S. government offersâ€”because they desperately want to receive floating SOFR or obtain Treasury collateral.Last print for 30y is â€“93â€¯bp, well below its longâ€‘run average around â€“80â€¯bp, and near its worst (â€“97â€¯bp on Aprilâ€¯8). Short tenors (2Y at â€“24â€¯bp) are â€œonlyâ€ modestly negative; the long end (20Y, 30Y) is far more inverted. This tells that stress is concentrated in longerâ€‘dated funding. (see my â€˜hidden QEâ€™ call) This signals signals severe funding and liquidity stress: banks would rather pay to receive floating (SOFR) than hold Treasuries, reflecting concerns over collateral scarcity, repo market strains and heightened credit risk.Historically, extreme negative swap spreads have preceded bondâ€‘market meltdowns (2008, 2020â€¦), foreshadowed equity drawdowns, as funding strains propagate to riskâ€‘assets via leveraged hedge funds and deltaâ€‘hedged positions and force central banks to adjust regulatory ratios (e.g., SLR waivers) or deploy liquidity backstops (standing repo, QE) to restore market functioning.It is the weighing machine, not the voting one.SubscribeThe key is again the timingâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysis"This time is different" | Weekly post (29/Dec - 02/Jan)Dec 28, 2025âˆ™ Paid1912ShareI hope, everyone of you is well and had a really good and rich time with their beloved onesâ€¦ Last week, Trump posted about inflation and good vs bad news. I relink my intraday post where I reacted to it in details. Please, read it before continueâ€¦What Trump said doesnâ€™t mean that market will never go down again. It means that they will do everything to push it higher, and I think, it will happen before the bubble bursts.Spring is a risk, and January FOMC too. As I keep saying, market became heavily manipulated, and so I donâ€™t see edge playing short-side. Iâ€™m net long, I hedge volatility only, and use the dips to buy into the bubble. Short sellers must be humiliated before market forms a dip, thats how old school big guys operateâ€¦This week we have FOMC Minutes on Tuesday 14.00PM ET;Half-day on Dec 31;Market is closed on ThursdayOkay, soThe GDP itself is very suspicious for the markets and inflation concerns emerged. Market started to reprice the easing cycle expectations, still the market went upward over the last week.The reason for that was the daily iron condors with heavily big sizes. At this level on such a low volume environment, it operates as an elevator that lifts up everything that is inside it, no matter what. These intraday positions completely counterbalanced the weekly bets of the market and forced those positions to be sold creating more mechanical upward pressure. In the weekly post I market, that the more the market goes farther from the centroid the more vol suppression we can expect, and market is expected to stabilize above 6915.75, with magnet of 6928.60; and that more vol was sold to the upside. We left a very low realized vol behind thanks to the ICs, but market will retest if the sentiment has actually followed the volatility or not. I see, the tension. And that tension will hit back.Ironically, this aggressively manipulated short vol trade created a rather fragile environment than stable. But I will scrutinize it belowâ€¦Structurally the tape shows upside vacuum towards 7010/15 zone, while on Monday open, the market left a gap. This gap doesnâ€™t really have magnetic effect as it was filled with liquidity before, so it should be supportive.We will scrutinize, what the market thinks about it. The problem that the market sees is that short vol and long spot trade is overcrowded, while it accumulated serious vol of vol and zomma risk (as you will see below). Realized volatility is currently at 9.37%, that is like ~4 pts below my target. This is not a multi year low, I even saw 4-5% RV during Trumpâ€™s first admin in Oct of 2017 before a ~10% squeeze up, before market finally corrected back 10%. We will see, but when vol of vol is grinding upward and the trade is crowded, then the whole structure becomes very fragile and sensitive to even a small increase in vol. And now, I donâ€™t see IC for the next weekâ€¦ SubscribeSo, stay awake, but the gap should be very supportive, and does not need to be filled. Letâ€™s look at the positioning, how the market sees this structure, and what levels it bets onâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Wellâ€¦ first of all, the russian version of the proposal is not a peace deal but an â€˜unconditional surrenderâ€™ deal, that the EU wonâ€™t ever accept. This whole right-wing â€œpro-peaceâ€ stance that conservative media and propaganda keep pushing means nothing more than avoiding conflicts by surrendering unconditionally. And that is exactly the same as when, at school, a bullied child tries to avoid being beaten up by becoming the lackey/slave of their bullies. We donâ€™t call that peace, we call it submission.The key red lines are that borders must not be changed by force and express concern about limits on Ukraineâ€™s armed forces, also abducted children must return to UA.EU has produced its own 28-point counter-plan which modifies the US draft in a more Ukraine-friendly direction. US - RUS negotiations are happening in Abu Dhabi. Whatâ€™s really happened is that Ukraineâ€™s national security adviser agreed to a peace proposal brokered by the Trump administration, but Zelenskyy will travel to Washington in the following days to check and finalise it. As much as I can tell, any deal that will be made wonâ€™t last. So, donâ€™t be optimistic about it. Russian foreign policy is a secret service tool. They play for make their opponent tired and lose their credibility until the russian pov will be accepted.

# US vs China war, Fed, + Intraday post (09/April)

> This is not 2008/09

Market analysisUS vs China war, Fed, + Intraday post (09/April)This is not 2008/09Apr 09, 2025âˆ™ Paid3962ShareFirst of all, Iâ€™m linking here my article on geopolitics and the New World Order geostrategy, which provides the overall context of the global situation.You can find this article pinned in the â€œMarket analysisâ€ category. I want to draw your attention to the fact that Iâ€™ll be continuously adding the most important updates to it.I ask everyone to study it, because these things are happeningâ€”and theyâ€™re happening right now. The US - China pokergameYesterday after the close, I explained that Trump is playing a very dangerous poker game with Xi.As Iâ€™ve stated many times, the goal of these tariffs is to force opponents to negotiate, banking on a controlled level of market panic that is then contained through swift policy action.I also explained that, according to historical political patterns, in times of crisis, the central parties cannot cooperate; rather, they gravitate toward their extreme â€˜cousinsâ€™: the right goes toward the far-right (nationalists), and the left goes toward the far-left (communists). The reason for this is their shared ideological roots, from which similar economic policies and geostrategic views follow.Consequently, the European Unionâ€”specifically the â€˜Coalition of the Willingâ€™ that represents the leftâ€”is searching for alternative alliances and new sources to maintain their current global-capitalist mode of operation. China is the communist superpower in the world. This shift is becoming increasingly visible to everyone.Since Trumpâ€™s goal is to bring the EU to its knees by 1) exposing the European economy to recessionâ€”even deflationâ€”and 2) exerting pressure on voter sentiment so they replace the uncooperative left-wing leaders, he must act very quickly with this tactic. Because if the EU finds new sources and allies with China, that will have serious consequences for the US... and for world security.Indeed, the EU will not sit down to negotiate with the US, nor will it accept the ceasefire agreement that Putin is asking forâ€”and that Trump must secure. This will derail the â€˜Holy Alliance 2.0â€™ plan, the US will face a severe economic downturn, and global security will be permanently shaken.With a new backer behind it, the EU can sustain the conflict with Russia, hoping for victory, while a weakened US becomes an easier target for China, which can then reclaim Taiwan.Needless to say, at that point there would be no more talk of NATO or the EU.Dormant conflicts would awaken, and the long-awaited world war would break out.(In Trumpâ€™s defense, itâ€™s worth emphasizing that it wasnâ€™t Trump who led the world to this point. Trump merely took on the conflict. Those who violated the NATOâ€“CSTO agreements in the past 30+ years, and globalized the Ukrainianâ€“Russian conflict instead of localizing it, are the ones who brought the world here. (These are very specific political definitionsâ€”look them up.)Likewise, those who allowed stagflation to developâ€”who stimulated Western economies on the demand side, instead of fixing the supply side after COVIDâ€”share blame. Then we wouldnâ€™t have stagflation now.Many poor and shortsighted decisions have led us to this point.)The stakes are extremely high. Trump must act quickly with tariffs on the EU, or else his plan will fail. Thereâ€™s no turning backâ€”doing so would be a show of weakness. The problem is stagflation, which tariffs and debt selling (as I previously predicted) only make worse.The deficit-to-GDP ratio is large and continues to grow. Printing money can only cover rising government spending in the short term, because the real value of money declines.Then investors begin to sell dollars. In addition, as investors gradually offload their U.S. Treasuries, there will be no one to finance the countryâ€™s expenses. Whatâ€™s more, interest rates will rise as a result. Government revenues go down. And if the government tries to fund itself through taxes, it slows the economy. All of this erodes U.S. hegemony and its influence on global economic processes.Meanwhile, the slowly awakening conflicts dissipate U.S. military power and generate further expenses. Russia and the Middle East have offered to finance the U.S. in the future, but trust is eroding worldwide rather than growing.The poker game here is that the U.S. has to push matters to the extreme in order to shake the global economy. Everyone must believe weâ€™re sliding into a deflationary spiral. The U.S. has every tool, all the money, and sufficient gold reserves to maintain its military and survive an economic crisis vis-Ã -vis China and the EU. (By â€˜survive,â€™ I mean preserving its power in the global economy.)However, the risk/reward ratio does not favor the U.S. this time. If confidence among Middle Eastern and Russian investors were permanently undermined, they could back out of the agreements previously negotiated and refuse to finance the U.S. in the future.And domestically, under globalist leadership, American society could wipe Trump out of government altogether through an american civil war. Thatâ€™s a very serious risk. Xi therefore hopes that Trump will fold his hand prematurely, in any sense.The U.S.â€“China economic war - that I keep talking about in the past 3 years - has begun. It is not a cold war anymore. Difficult and very risky times lie ahead, and we face an increasing number of unpredictable events that hinge on the decisions and moods of world leaders and billionaires. (Most of those are irrational)The world order is changing.Fed is in troubleTariffs are expected to weaken hiring and spending, pushing the economy closer to recession. However, these same tariffs are likely to raise prices on many imported goods and materials, which feeds into overall inflation and gives central bankers pause about loosening policy too early.Because of these conflicting pressures, rate cuts (which could help with growth) might worsen inflation, while maintaining higher rates to curb inflation could deepen a slowdown in employment and spending.Economists, business owners, and investors are already betting that the combined effects of tariffs will push the economy toward recession. Many are expecting that when the economy begins to slow sharply, the Fed will eventually need to cut rates. However, thereâ€™s considerable uncertaintyâ€”investors are not convinced that the Fed can swing the policy needle quickly or decisively enough to avoid negative fallout. If business sentiment deteriorates due to the tariff shock, and if the Fed is seen as too slow to counteract it, the credibility of U.S. monetary policy could be undermined. Powellâ€™s standpoint is to fully understand the economic impact before making a major policy change. Heâ€™s waiting to see a significant weakening in the labor market or a clear signal from inflation data before taking action. But delaying a rate cut too long might allow the slowdown to deepen, while an early move could ignite persistent inflation.From this, you can see exactly what Xi is playing at.He knows there are still those who would bail out and finance the U.S. economy. He also knows that if China and the EU (plus the BRICS as a whole) buckle, Trump will roll back most of the tariffs. This is crucial.But Xi is trying to drag this out until the loss of confidence in the U.S. is too great and the U.S. backs down from the economic war.

# VIX downside vomma 'risk', remember? + Intraday post (03/July)

Market analysisVIX downside vomma 'risk', remember? + Intraday post (03/July)Jul 03, 2025âˆ™ Paid111ShareGood morning to everyone who loves the whiff of that fresh-mattered morning NFP print.Yesterday I posted a new educational article about my trading principles covering both practical applications and principiums. Take your time to read and re-read it. Algos are set to take a recessionary print as positive-to-neutral today, while an inflationary print would be taken more like flat. Btw, last night, I digged into tariffs and datas a bit more... Tariffs act like some sales taxes on imports, raising prices at the checkout, because importers pass the duty on to consumers. In this economic environment nominal income growth underpins nominal spending growth, even tho credit growth remains dampened (DPI +0.8%, PCE +0.2% - illustrating how income gains still support spending; Consumer Credit +4.3% - below past credit-fuelled cycles).The 90 days pause led to a surge in arrivals at US ports roughly three weeks after its announcement, basically pulling forward demand masking the fact that core income dynamic still underpins the cycle. Now, core macro theory holds that when nominal incomes lag price rises, households either draw down savings, borrow more, or cut real spending. This would cause GDP growth slowdown and profit margin compression. Trump's work-visa rescissions and ICE raids already tightened the labor market. Basically any drop in foreign-born labor keeps the unemployment rate artificially low and bolsters wages, regardless of tariff policy. So it generates a wage inflation as firms are forced to pay more for scarce labor. And this is independent from the tariffs! This is crucial. Plus, across used cars, hotels/STRs, raw materials, housing, restaurants, and wages, we can see demand-pull pressures as too much demand chasing too few goods.And if I'm right, then stagflation is actually worsening and the Fed's â€œneutralâ€ rate has likely shifted higher. This will tighten Fed's room again to cut rates, and this is why I see growth concerns ('bad news are bad news' regime) looming back through bonds vs equities.I want you to remember something I showed you in the weekly postâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Vol higher lows? Fed, skews, etc. - Intraday post (24/June)

Market analysisVol higher lows? Fed, skews, etc. - Intraday post (24/June) Jun 24, 2025âˆ™ Paid133ShareSKEW, FED, VOL OF VOL SUPPLYWe have some war premium unwind during the overnight session on the cease fire news. However, Friday 22 delta fixed strike skew went up by 1.91% since yesterday close and by 4.49% since last Friday, and down into EOM by -1.61%; this reinforces the weekend postâ€™s dynamics, and note also, that July OpEx skew went up by 1.35% since yesterday. The 5 delta put skews show only 0.51% increase into Friday expo, 0.01% into EOM and 2.56% into July OpEx since yesterday. VIX also didnâ€™t changed too much, only decimals, a bit steeper. Fed funds futures also went up only by 9.22% but actually down by -5.15% on a monthly basis (avg moves here). Fed faces a lose-lose stagflation dilemma. Which one would be the better evil. Any pathâ€”cutting or holding ratesâ€”risks long-term damage to the Fedâ€™s credibility and independence. Cutting rates under political duress may produce short-term gains yet compromise the Fedâ€™s apolitical mandate, while holding steady could invite harsher political attacks if growth slows.The broader FOMCâ€”including the voting regional presidentsâ€”remains cautious, implying the Fed may delay action until clearer data emerge on inflation and growth. Many policymakers refuse to cut rates until the uncertainties around tariffs and their impact on inflation, growth, and jobs are resolved, so my guess is that the Fed will await more clarity on trade-policy effects before easing.Market doesnâ€™t fear left-tail event, that Iâ€™m keep emphatizing. During the next month market is supported by vol of vol supply, until oil-crisis happenes. August - Sept window will be taugh. The supportive effect comes from the short vanna flow and net vol grind-up, as I keep explaining. Short vanna = vol up/delta down, forcing dealers to buy deltas. If vol would be sold, that would also cap any downside grind, bcs of the downside vega and gamma supply. On this week, the mechanical flows point towards mechanical vol selling, that would provide pressure on the spot. During the overnight, fix strike skew and RV actually went up, on this squeeze. Tbh, for me the conflict doesnâ€™t seem finishedSubscribeAnd reversion model shows 81.65% probability for a reversion, that I would interpret as profit taking and vol selling (both mechanical due to long vomma, and speculative). But as you can see in the skew, nothing actually changed. The only thing, that short-term changed is macro focus. But this is also temporal. The underlying focus is still on growth-concerns, and SPX/yields beta showed â€œbad news are bad newsâ€ regime. But now, it is artificially changed through Bessent put, and Fed speakers rhetoric, to spread dovish hint, shifting the regime into â€œbad news are good newsâ€. This prevents any left-tail events, a preemptive move, nothing more. Only temporal. This caps GOLD, Oil and volatility. basically a metaphorical â€œvol of vol supplyâ€. The thing is, that this regime still doesnâ€™t favor for upside liquidity build-up.

Market analysisVol higher lows - Weekly post (23-27/June) Jun 23, 2025âˆ™ Paid1814ShareThe volatility landscape didnâ€™t changed significantly since last Sunday. Market analysisVolatility flows, Sentiment read and OpEx - Weekly post (16-20/June)AlmaÂ·June 15, 2025Last week, we had a sentiment shift towards growth concerns, inevitably suppressive vol selling feedback loop that ended up in a red 80%+ reversion signal to own the market on the short side. But spot closed above the sentiment-flip level.Read full storyYou can see how vol of vol realized to the downside, along with realized volatility, with a weekly spot down/vol down move that is a typical short vanna behavior, as I kept explaining it publicly too.And term structure also keeps developping as expected: The setup favors for a natural grind up in volatility into August, until the positions expire, and market collapses when tariff effects hit the economy and the vol marketâ€¦ Bessentâ€™s machniations are not that succesful yet. What causes this, is the dealer short veta effect that naturally builds a floor for the vol suppressing moves, making it shape higher lows. While long vomma makes sure to dampen any spikes in volatility. This also causes short zomma in the index, meaning, that as vol grinds slowly higher, gamma decreases giving more room for vol to grow. These are mechanical effects. The short vanna position in the index, swallows every downside vol, also coming hand-in-hand with short speed (longer downside gamma). But gamma effects are more significant in the front-end tenors, and mostly locally. Another important layer is that the growing vol expands the range of the short vanna and flattens its curve, decreasing its impact. So while the flip points slide farther, the vol effect on deltas decreases and the moves can slowly accelerate as local gammas will also be eaten up by the zomma. But here, the local, daily positions, sharp short speed exposures, etc. can manage the downside vol. Why it is happening? 1) Bessent put, 2) geo risk.Market is all about the illusion of growth now, but we know since April that we are in a bear marketâ€¦ Letâ€™s look at the weekly positioning, and the levels that actually have meaning within the noiseâ€¦ SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Vol selling, geo-risk premium + Intraday post (13/June)

Market analysisVol selling, geo-risk premium + Intraday post (13/June)Jun 13, 2025âˆ™ Paid101ShareSPX is trading at 5987.3 when Iâ€™m writing these linesâ€¦Got a nice 130 pts profit on Wednesday shorts during the overnight. Today is again a wait-and-observe day. The reason is because, after profiting this much, I simply donâ€™t feel the need to gamble if the market is trading in a pivotal zone. The overnight decline is explained by the Iran - Israel conflict, but in fact, it was an inevitable result of the weekly volatility flows as I explained on Sunday, reinforced by the data releases (sentiment shift) and amplified by the attack. Look where realized vvol is trading and where implied vomma is trading: Synthetic tail OTM SPX put selling is still there but MM delta is making higher lows in a net basis. Market is still complacent, despite SPX fix strike skew spiked yesterday on weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. But again: vol selling is still on (suppressive for any upside move, but stabilizing for any downside move).SubscribeThe U.S. dollar has fallen to its lowest in over three years amid cooling inflation prints and tariff relief hopes, as traders push out Fed-cut expectations to September and beyond. Because despite near-target inflation, uncertainties from tariffs and a swelling federal deficit are keeping the Fed cautious on policy shifts. If Israel refrains from additional attacks, the risk premium in oil is likely to fadeâ€”making a sustained jump above current levels unlikely. These Middle East tensions inject a clear downside risk into global equities by threatening the U.S. disinflation narrativeâ€”a sudden oil shock could undo recent gains against inflation and force investors into safer, less risky assets.Basically near-term volatility hinges on the next moves in Jerusalem and Tehran; without a fresh cycle of strikes, the geo-premium should recede, but any new escalation will keep energy markets jittery and equity risk premia elevated. Here are the levels that matter from sentiment-wise: SPX: 5968ES=F: 5976.81SPY: 595.89NDX: 21,585NQ=F: 21,620.68VIX: 18.60 - 22.33VVIX: 96.00 - 103.15Continued vol selling will keep market swings contained, favoring premium-selling strategies and liquidity-providing chops, supportive from the downside for now. Except if vol-of-vol event happens (e.g., credit shock, geopolitical flashpoint), reversing vol positioning and swallowing all the downside gammas.

Market analysisVol selling + Intraday post (03/June)Jun 03, 2025âˆ™ Paid123ShareThe admin wonâ€™t let this market to crash for now. As said, June OpEx looks supportive, and the whole market just looks rangebounding on vol and vvol supply. At least until late July - early August.I will tell when I see the opportunity for a trend-trade (and that will be on the short side most likely). Letâ€™s go through some datasâ€¦By May 30, USD/JPY traded around 144.04, down from an average near 149 earlier in 2025â€”a yen appreciation of â‰ˆ3 % over the month. This signals a global risk-off shift. The relative performance of Consumer Discretionary vs Consumer Staples (the XLY/XLP ratio) has collapsed to fresh lows. Recent flows show hedge funds dumping discretionary names amid concern over tariffs and spending, while staples have caught a defensive bid. A lower XLY/XLP ratio means investors favor essentials (staples) over big-ticket, cyclical goods (discretionary). The DJTA fell from 14 831.24 on May 27 to 14 686.30 by May 30â€”a decline of about 1.0 % over those three sessions. This indicates slowing demand and can foreshadow broader equity weakness.U.S. 10-year yields swung from a peak near 4.62 % (mid-May) down to 4.16 % by month-end, then back into the 4.4 % areaâ€”in one week alone they moved >40 bp. Such intra-month whipsaws reflect deep uncertainty over tariffs, Fed policy, and global liquidity.Spot gold closed May 30 at $3 315.48/oz, up +1.69 % on the dayâ€”and roughly +2 % over the prior two sessions. This uptick (a safe-haven rally) confirms inflation fears + risk aversion. Despite mixed headlines, tamer PCE data kept real yields low, allowing gold to rally.The Markit CDX North American IG Index (5-year) widened to 64.9 bp on April 3 (highest since Nov 2023), then constricted back toward the mid-30 bp area by May 30, ending at 32.82 bpâ€”a ~50 % retracement. This means spreads are tightening, implying investors are less fearful of defaults. However, this tightening may be more liquidity-driven (banks chasing carry) than confidence-drivenâ€”a hallmark of slippery, short-lived rallies until macro/event risk eases.

Market analysisVolatility flows, Sentiment read and OpEx - Weekly post (16-20/June)Jun 15, 2025âˆ™ Paid322ShareLast week, we had a sentiment shift towards growth concerns, inevitably suppressive vol selling feedback loop that ended up in a red 80%+ reversion signal to own the market on the short side. But spot closed above the sentiment-flip level. The June 2025 Israelâ€“Iran escalation (â€œOperation Rising Lionâ€) triggered a flight to quality across multiple markets: U.S. Treasury yields fell amid a bull-steepening of the curve as investors sought safe havens, the yen reacted sharply, signaling unwinding of yen-funded carry trades. Persistent Middle East tensions could keep the yen bid, hindering a sustainable carry revival.Dark-pool data shows institutional equity outflows as a pre-OpEx defensive move, underscoring private-venue activity as a barometer of large-account risk aversion. Funds target convexity via structured-product hedges on oil and FX, anticipating what the vol market shows usâ€¦I posted this on Twitter, in case you missed it. Dropped some important infos.First, we will look at the volatility flows, because they are the ones that matter the most nowâ€¦ SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Vomma supply, Short vanna, Risk - Intraday post (29/Aug)

Market analysisVomma supply, Short vanna, Risk - Intraday post (29/Aug)Aug 29, 2025âˆ™ Paid11ShareWeekly post: Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)AlmaÂ·August 24, 2025Last week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.Read full story(Yesterday post was free for everybody)Here I wrote about PCE: NVDA ER, GDP, PCE, Valuation - Intraday post (27/Aug)AlmaÂ·August 27, 2025Read full storyVomma supply is on (grey line), and very heavy, as we keep seeing it day by day, week by week: especially on the right-tail, because spot/vol beta is about 21.01% with an avg of 16.24%: The reason is illiquidity and short squeeze. I also note here that 3m realized volatility is at 9.38% while 1m-RV is at 10.11%, while realized vvol is sold from 81.3% to 26.59% in only one week! This is an agressive â€œhigher for longerâ€ vol environment making quant funds to scale out of long exposures, decreasing insitutional buying flow in terms of investment purpose (because they buyback hedges, levered up through MM buybacks as well, as put spreads etc. are closed).This means that the current SPX levels are not stable at all, and will be held until Sept cut, simultanously compressing risk premium. In the weekly post, I already elaborated on the reason of this. This is a cautious â€œstairstep-upâ€/â€elevator upâ€ kind of scenario, while funds cautiously keep upside squeezes in check as well. Through vomma supply, concentrated on the right-tail of the distribution, they create a â€œbrakingâ€ effect, in order to extend this melt-up momentum. With this, long vol/long delta strategies canâ€™t really capitalize on this move, while locking the cheapness of the downside hedges, vvariances for the future correction. The secondary effect is cooling down quant algos that take the velocity of the momentum into account, so they meassure lower risk.  If volatility would be sold, market would not find enough liquidity at these levels. Simply because, market is about supply and demand balance. If customers sell vanna, they bet on negative spot/vol correlation (simply because the delta vs. volatility relationship is inverse in this position). Now, firstly it opens up the left-tail; secondly, when spot goes through the centroid of the vanna and speed profile to the upside, the imbalance shifts to the sell-side. In order to realize the distribution bet, market needs customers who buy all these sold assets at those prices. And this selling flow is increasing as spot is climbing upward. It is clear now that there is no such high buying liquidity here that could swallow all that potential selling, because there is no faith, no fundamental support for that. Funds are scaling out to cash and safe-havens, and retails are highly volatile traders. However, through buying vanna from dealers, levering-up the upside squeeze, once can amplify the move, but also braking it simultanously by flattening the convexity through vomma selling. And as said, the ultimate benefit is cheap hedges against vol squeezes in the futureâ€¦ Donâ€™t forget: itâ€™s not about inflation, itâ€™s about the growing debt burden!This is what Trump is aiming to manage. And this is why he slowly gains full control on Fed and othersâ€¦Also, we will see EOM rebalancing from investors who reduce their stock exposures due to the high risk, and buying bonds and safe havens. The reason is the high stock prices, that increases the weight of stocks in the portfolio against low risk assets. It caps upside.

Market analysisWe aren't out of the wood, Intraday post (07/April)Apr 07, 2025âˆ™ Paid211ShareMy weekly post and last weekly post are crucial. Basically those three posts I linked at the beginning.China is about to launch its retaliation in response to the US tariffs, along with Japan. As I mentioned a week ago, if they start selling US Treasuries, it would be catastrophic for the US market. However, even in the midst of the biggest chaos, letâ€™s not forgetâ€”something I canâ€™t stress enoughâ€”that all this is measured out beforehand. Not entirely, of course, but Trump knows exactly what heâ€™s doing. He and his insider partners have every tool at their disposal to rescue the economy from a recession and prevent a deflationary spiral. But deflation fears need to be priced into the market. Stagflation must disappear from the data completely, so that the next QE into Q3 doesnâ€™t trigger another inflation cycle.The UK hasnâ€™t made a decision yet. The EU so far hasnâ€™t retaliated significantly, but itâ€™s signaling that itâ€™s willing to restructure itself from globalist capitalism into a more flexible stance.As I said, any long delta position I take is also short vega, vanna, and vomma, and long theta and charm. And Iâ€™m being extremely cautious. As I wrote, the market has only just entered the woods.Any bounceâ€”or rather grind upâ€”will be used to build a lifeboat. Red flags are gathering in the market.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market is a bit uncertain about how it should value the datas it has and tech of course. Trump wants to manage debt burden, Powell wants to manage inflation. On the short-run, the sentiment leans towards bad news are good news. So, market leans towards Trumpâ€™s pov, and wants stimulus on the short-run. Market is more concerned of growth. But needs confirmation in this sentiment by assuring investors that inflation will be managed and keeping rates lower is necessary.This is very well reflected in the price action, as spot just stopped at the primal weekly upside target, and now volatility starts to become more sensitive. For today, the market is still confidently selling puts, but not as confidently as before, while does not expect 6880/6900 to be broken this week. it shows a pattern that they fear the malign market reaction for a weak PCE print, while it would provide room for the Fed to cut (both in terms of growth metrics and marketâ€™s wealth effect wiseâ€¦ not too much tho, but more than nothing).This is why I said: pivotal window here.SubscribeBut now lets jump into the daily positioning breakdownâ€¦Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisWeekly post (10-14/march)Putting it all togetherMar 09, 2025âˆ™ Paid5073ShareThis is the initial bias, the story, that this market is all about now. It is very important to understand, as we can see it evolving. On Feb 3th I wrote:â€donâ€™t forget that this growth was boosted by fake fundamentals since Covid, that resulted in stagflation. How? I covered this already on X, but, the key stations are:During the pandemic, governments and the Fed flooded the economy with liquidity (â€œFed putâ€ of 2020),Lockdowns, factory shutdowns, and shipping bottlenecks caused significant supply shortages,Businesses started to panick, leading to over-ordering in an attempt to meet future demand,Once the supply chains normalized, the delayed influx of goods hit the market all at once,And this is the key, because as a result businesses suddenly found themselves with too much inventory as demand began to slow,At this point, it was clear that inflation will resurge in critical areas like services, housing, and wages leading to stagflation (while the narrative was the victory over inflation, the reality was that policymakers underestimated structural inflation risks caused by massive debt, wage pressures, and persistent supply-side issues)This is very important to remember during this big cycle.So the growth can be sustained on the short run, AIs can support the bull market narrative until summer at least (and the momentum can be stabilized after the new gov took everything to their placeâ€¦ different environment now, the shift naturally causes uncertainity), but on the long run, market knows that something is just off with this inflation cycle, and if it breaks out of control, the pivot will be nasty, even deflational spiral.â€To put my geo post into context, this is crucial to understand that the desinflation was caused by the bullwhip-cycle back then, and the stimulus on that led directly to this stagflationary environment. In these times politics, economy and market breath together.Nobody wants deflational spiral. It would be catasthrophic. And lika that, we can see it getting priced out in EU.  On Feb 24 I explained you my â€˜spot decayâ€™ call that we are seeing evolving: with relatively increased SPX/VIX beta, due to the constant intraday local negative speed environment to ensure slow, mechanistic decay (via VWAP/TWAP type strategies): So, lets put it all togetherâ€¦The rich put wing, backwardated term structures, and CTAs and leveraged ETF de-leveraging, with rebalancing trades keeps providing downside pressure on the markets, concetrated in tech sectors.

Market analysisWeekly post (12-16/May)The pivotal weekMay 11, 2025âˆ™ Paid263ShareI already shared my current main bias for this week. It didnâ€™t changed, but in this post I will share the levels and the momentum that Iâ€™m looking for. Credit spreads are still very tight by historical standards but have crept wider since mid-2024. The Fedâ€™s balance-sheet runoff has driven reserve balances down to about $3.2 trillion and reverse-repo usage to roughly $155 billion, though weekly flows remain erratic. SOFR futures trade around 95.75 for June â€™25 and rise to about 96.46 for December â€™25â€”implying a peak SOFR near 4.25 percent and cuts back toward 3.5â€“3.6 percent by year-end. The effective fed funds rate sits at 4.33 percent, about 247 basis points above the Richmond Fedâ€™s 1.86 percent neutral estimate, signaling a restrictive stance. And on May 11, China called the Geneva talks â€œcandid, in-depth and constructiveâ€ and said a joint statement with â€œgood newsâ€ will follow soon. The talks appear to have produced a formal accord on narrowing the bilateral deficit and de-escalating tariffs, with details imminent. Very important event, and the timing is not a coincidenceâ€¦SOFR futures are pricing in an imminent peak and a series of rate cuts stretching into 2026. Policy stance remains explicitly restrictive (Fed funds > neutral by ~2.6 pp), even as markets lean toward easing ahead. Fed is in tightening/normalization mode but with markets already looking for the pivotâ€”and credit conditions beginning to reflect a bit more stress. Longer-run forecasts (3.5â€“4 %) imply the Fed will likely keep policy restrictive through 2025 before easing. April CPI is expected to show a modest uptick but remain well below mid-2022 highs. This is the week I was talking about when Trump visits the Middle-East, and sentiment-wise we can expect that the current bullrun gets a narrative or not (as you already know, I personally believe that it most likely will).

Market analysisWeekly post (14-18/July)Jul 13, 2025âˆ™ Paid251ShareWe have datas this week. CPI on Tuesday, PPI on Wednesday, Retail Sales on Thursday, and Unemployment rate on Friday. Plus it is OpEx week.  The thing is that recession odds are going up again, as stagflationary slowdown is there driven by higher import levies. As you all know, Trump extended July 9 tariff deadlines to August 1 and threatened new levies (up to 35% on Canada, 50% on copper), keeping trade-policy uncertainty elevated. Import-price data this week will be the first hard read on how these renewed threats feed into inflation.In short,For PPI the consensus is +2.6%, factory-gate inflation matching or beating expectations would foreshadow further consumer inflation;Retail Sales should rebound modesty after Mayâ€™s steep drop, otherwise it increases recession concerns;Sharp import-price jumps would confirm tariff pass-through, adding to headline CPI risk;Contraction in Real Earnings would erode spending power and weigh on consumption, amplifying stagflation concerns;CPI is trivial. Consensus is +0.3%Also we have earnings too. Tech and industrial reports are very important in terms of commentary on supply-chain disruptions, tariff pass-through and end-market demand, reinforcing the stagflation versus soft-landing narrative. While retail and consumer-staples earnings (e.g., PepsiCo) will be watched for consumption trends amid rising prices and the wealth effect backdrop.For the coming week, what I see momentum-wise is that the SPX should perform 6255.89 in average in order to maintain the positive disbalance, and should remain above 6135.67 in order to aavoid shifting into the negative pathâ€¦ Downside odds are 84.44% SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisWeekly post (17-21/march) Mar 17, 2025âˆ™ Paid2822ShareIn this post I explained the geo context, that is crucial important bcs in these times where the world order is about to shift, the geopolitics, economy and market are breathing together.Here I explained the spot decay again and touched this OpEx - EOM window dynamics with JPM collar vs OpEx.I want to add, that on multiple occasions, the 1987 Washington Agreement between the Soviet Union and the USA has been mentionedâ€”a deal in which both sides pledged to dismantle their ground-launched intermediate and shorter-range missiles. In 2019, Donald Trump was the first to withdraw from this agreement, followed by Vladimir Putin the very next day. Yet both parties continue to indicate willingness to abide by its terms on the condition that they can conduct official inspections at each otherâ€™s missile bases at any time. Of course, no such inspections have taken place officially since then.On July 8, 1997 when NATO invited Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to join, Russia and NATO signed the Founding Act, in which Russia accepted NATOâ€™s future eastern expansions. In return, NATO promised not to deploy nuclear weapons within these new member states and, barring national security needs, not to station any further military forces in those countries. NATO fully adhered to this agreement until 2014, and even at the outbreak of the Crimean conflicts, it only stationed a symbolic number of troops along its border.Furthermore, last December, Russia presented the USA and NATO with a near-ultimatum in the form of a draft treaty. They demanded: 1) the former Soviet states that are not yet NATO members must never be allowed to join NATO; 2) NATO must not deploy strike capabilities, either near the Russian border or within Ukraine, and 3) NATO must roll back its infrastructure to its pre-1997 status.NATO rejected points 1 and 3, but was willing to negotiate on point 2â€”however, those negotiations have yet to take place.The issue, therefore, runs far deeper than what the media suggests. Neither side is beyond reproach, but it was NATO that began to violate agreements with an aggressive approach towards Russian borders, while Russiaâ€”whose identity inherently involves feeling perpetually threatenedâ€”took preemptive steps against NATO.This is the problem that needs solution. As I always say, a peace reached too quickly is no real peace, and a partial ceasefire is no real ceasefire. Progress is slow, but itâ€™s happening. Fortunately, thereâ€™s no rush among the guys in Jeddah, and as far as I hear, negotiations are heading in a good directionâ€”just inch by inch.

Not an easy marketâ€¦ This is not for investors but for tradersâ€¦ Next risk window, if the market passes this text, is the Sept OpEx/FOMC window (I will specify then). Due to bond markets the odds shifted towards that window, but only like a 45/55% in favor for Sept vol risk.

Market analysisWeekly post (24-28/feb)Setting the toneFeb 23, 2025âˆ™ Paid3235Share In the last two hours of Friday we saw VIX down by 2.25% along with CBOE Implied Correlation Index, while SPX hit 6009 then closed at 6013 huge long gamma strike. In order to see longer spot/vol correlation you need to see the P/C skew moving down. This is bcs the supply and demand disbalance is shifting towards the OTM calls from OTM puts, reflecting in their IVs on a fixed strike basis. This was no surprise as we saw the shorter downside speed in the SPX positioning.However, in order to see longer spot/VIX beta, you need to see the whole smirk shifting, including the far OTM contracts as well.  Coding chain datas from IBKR, we can see that the current ATM strike moved from 11.4% to 10.4% into Monday expo, and a feb24 5delta put moved from 18.8% to 17.2%, and a feb24 10 delta put (essentially a synthetic VIX call) from 16.2% to 14.7%  This is why you saw longer spot/VIX betaâ€¦ from mechanical perspective.To me, the interesting part was timing.

Market analysisWeekly post (24-28/march)Bias into EOM, JPM collarMar 23, 2025âˆ™ Paid55413ShareThe essence of Friday's supportive OpEx laid, on one hand, in the fact that after the AM expo, dealers had to buy back a significant amount of delta, as I had signaled before the opening. On the other hand, the local positioning was long vanna, short charm, and long color, which reduced the negative gamma effect as the day progressed. In addition, the overall positioning was neutral-to-suppressive, with almost zero negative speed exposure, which, along with declining vol, compressed the delta exposure during the day and thus prevented any rally whatsoever. But most importantly, it was the algorithms operating in HF mean reversion trading and long dispersion mode, which I have been continuously signaling for dynamism over the past weeks, whose natural consequence was the suppression of the range of daily returnsâ€”and consequently, of volatility. This was supportive in the local long vanna environment.And why does oscillation occur, why is there a need for low volatility? Read this and this post, or this one.Now that we're past OpEx, we need to determine what the market wants until the end-of-month expiry. And this is where the JPM collar will come into effect. So now I write a bit about it again in advance.JPM Put Spread CollarJPM hedge equity operation actually consists of three funds, with JHEQX being the largest. These funds operate continuously and have overlapping expirations.Unlike a traditional protective collar trade, this fund uses a debit spread. The extra premium gained from selling the put option lets the manager raise the call strike and increase the cap. This spread protects against losses beyond roughly 5%, but after about 20% losses, the protection ends and performance tracks the market oneâ€‘toâ€‘one. It does not offer coverage against extreme tail events. Also they use SPXW options (EOM, PMâ€‘settled), so execution and resetting are tied to the closing settlement.Once the collar is established around 2 PM (the official settlement), the fund managers do not actively adjust or roll the position. This is a common misconception. Instead, the collar simply expires, and they reset it with a new one. Thereâ€™s no active monetization of the collar during its lifetime. Since the new collar adds further short delta exposure, they also open a 0DTE call leg to neutralize that delta.See the official brochure here.Here you can see the 4700/5565/6165 collar on EOM expo:Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisWeekly post (24-29/Aug)Aug 24, 2025âˆ™ Paid136ShareLast week I said that any vol spike keeps being managed through vomma supply during this whole month, and any directional momentum must be confirmed, because everything is uncertain again.I predicted sell-off and vol up for Tuesday and Wednesday and stabilization after, it happened, then on Friday I warned that if Powell is benign, market will spike back up to 6430 (it overshot). So the momentum was there, but it was never confirmed as spot failed to close below the weekly range.I also warned during the week (when market was still down) that the risk window probability is shifting towards the second half of September, implying that this downside momentum wonâ€™t see continuation.I tell you whyâ€¦Whatâ€™s happening is clear salesman-business on the market.1) if you can create a narrative that makes funds short the long end of the inflation curve, they wonâ€™t decrease their long-exposures;2) positive monthly SPX/yields betas on the short-end makes investors increase their long exposures on equities if yields are being sold - something Bessent is sweating to do;3) you can heavily sell the skew and vomma for the dealers to create constant short speed and short vanna profiles, levering up the buy-the-dip flows while simultaniously dampen any possible vol spikes through them (basically selling wide fly spreads on different tenors), creating a positively skewed platykurtic distribution4) as risk is meassured in two dimensions (spot and time axis), with these managed sell-offs the mean reversion algos, momentum and volatility based risk metrics can be cooled down, so funds can increase exposures while buying back hedges (and in case of options, the flow is levered up through them); This is only four ways to manage the downside and create an artificial stairstep-up move, that pulls in more speculative buyers further reinforcing the move. The reason is simple: they need to create a good sentiment for the market in order to win investors confidence. If market would be down, the sentiment would not favor to make investors valuate this market too high. But as the performance is good, and market is very much seems to be valuated high on this rate cut thing, investors might get more confidence, so do long-term traders. This way, the underlying uncertainity about the hawkish side of this cut (instead of a new stable QE-cycle) can be masked, and a â€œlow value product can be sold for higher priceâ€. Because the reason is not disfinlation, but recession risk. But it will matter only until the cut happens. For now, the only goal is to valuate this market as high as it can be to hold sentiment pumped.

Market analysisWeekly post (feb17-21), OpEx weekFeb 16, 2025âˆ™ Paid4983ShareWe have monthly OpEx this week.Realized volatility came down during the past sessions, as expected despite the continous negative headlines. As I explained, market cleary signaled that they didnâ€™t care about the news, they only wanted to catch volatility, but it reflexively led to lower vol, printed into realized volatility: Coding 3m RV at 12.97% and 20 day rolling RV at 14.29%Vol control strategies and CTAs are started to increase their exposure as their estimated net multipliers went above one. For simpliciy for now, here I give you two formulas:  Exposure multiplier=ÏƒtargetÏƒcurrentWeightassetâˆ1ÏƒassetThe first formula expresses that if target volatility is equals to current vol, the multiplier is one. But if the current vol value goes below the target vol, the multiplier will be greater than one, meaning, they will increase their exposures (and conversely, if the current vol goes above the target vol, the multiplier will be lower than one, making them proportionaly decrease their exposure).While the second formula expresses, that the weight of a certain assetâ€™s in the portfolio is proportional to the reciproc of the vol, or in other words, the position size in each asset is inversely proportional to its volatility. This is called risk parity. The lower the volatility goes, the higher its weight becomes in the portfolio, resulting increased buying activity. Here is an other formula is: Î“=eâˆ’rfÏ„SÏƒÏ„n(d1)This is gamma derived from Black-Scholes model, where: d1=lnâ¡SK+(r+12Ïƒ2)(Tâˆ’t)ÏƒTâˆ’t If we consider an ATM contract (S=K), the dâ‚ term is near to zero meaning n(dâ‚) is near its max. As both time t and volatility Ïƒ shrinks, the gamma will increase. Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# What is volatility?

Educational postsWhat is volatility?Math warning!Jan 25, 2025âˆ™ Paid611410Share In this article, I'm going to introduce the concept of volatility, log return, and standard deviation, providing the mathematical background to help you gain a better understanding of these concepts. I will also introduce the four main volatility formulas to illustrate the evolution of volatility estimation: Parkinson, Garman-Klass, Roger-Satchell, and Yang-Zhang.Math warning!When we talk about volatility, we look at the returns rather than closing prices because returns reveal the actual magnitude and direction of the daily price changes, standardizing the measurement of price variability across time and different assets.By definition, volatility is the annualized standard deviation of the periodic logarithmic returns. And like this volatility basically shows us the â€œreal velocityâ€ of the price action indirectly giving us a picture about the liquidity at certain spot levels. Liquidity means how easy it is to turn an asset back into cash. The higher the liquidity, the easier and more cost efficient it is to do, and vice versa. if volatility is low, this means that the log returns are compressing as a result of high buying and selling activity at certain territories, because the interest are met there. Au contrary, when volatility is high, this means that the buyers and sellers must â€œlook for each otherâ€, and so the price movements expand, so does volatility.But now, letâ€™s dissect this definition of log returns starting with math basicsâ€¦What is logarithmic return?Return is the profit on a trade which the trader receives from that position over a given time period.Letâ€™s say Váµ¢ is the initial value of our capital and the end value is Vâ‚‘Then simple return is:Return=Veâˆ’ViViContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.Next

Market analysisWhat is vomma supply? Why is it important? - Intraday post (04/Sept)Sep 04, 2025âˆ™ Paid161ShareAs everybody already knows that the coming Fed cut will be a hawkish cut due to the checkmate situation, volatility keeps being managed for this week and day to day.Vomma selling is basically like selling VIX calls or selling tail SPX OTM puts/calls for the dealers and bidding up gamma at the tails. It doesnâ€™t prevent wider intraday swings, it lets the spot moves kinda freely in a relatively wide range, but it prevents vol spikes, it dampens any upsticks, by compressing the kurtosis of the distribution. This is a less agressive strategy than constantly selling volatility, dumping it down to hell, like it was done in 2022. Those setups are like an extended rubber band, they are very sensitive to any vol spikes, leading into a vol squeeze.For a vomma squeeze, market needs extreme tail event. But we need to know where the â€œevent horizonz" of the tailâ€ lies. Thats something I built formulas for as well. So vomma supply doesnâ€™t mean that volatility is suppressed. It only means that, the more vol goes up, the more vol exposure the dealers get, so they will sell volatility. (think like this: long vomma = vol up/vega up = selling vega by dealers to hedge)Or think about it like supplying the dealers with VIX upside gamma. And because VIX smirk is mostly concave (especially for longer maturities), but have an upward skew for sure (it is because of the modelled mean reverting tendency of volatility), when VIX spikes, dealers will have a lot to delta hedge (and maybe VIX-vega hedge as well, but itâ€™s conditional), capping the vol spike, and creating a VIX-to-SPX lead-lag. This is because VIX is the 30-day variance object derived from SPX options, so spot moves change SPX option vol premiums and so thus the implied variance curve (think vanna/cross-gamma), which moves VIX futures. To reduce this additional exposure, dealers add an ES hedge sized by the VXâ€“ES beta. The result is buying ES futures at the tail strikes, dampening or even braking the spot move. It can work both ways, as I keep telling. Because spot/vol correlation can be both positive and negative.The third thing is to simply sell tail SPX puts, that are basically synthetic VIX calls. You can see a lot of this on these intraday setups, OptionsDepth Heatmapsâ€¦ especially to the upside, because in the recent times, intraday setups and even weekly/monthly setups where kept being right-tail heavy. And so, by creating positive gammas to both upside and downside, it simply builds heavy gamma walls to the spot that swallow vol spike-driven spot moves, by leveraging dealer hedging flow. The net result is a compressed kurtosis for SPX distribution. Thinner tails, reduced tail-risks to both direction, and controlled volatility swings. SubscribePlaying with inflation swaps or any assets that fits the narrative is only a metaphorical â€œvomma supplyâ€ as it keeps sentiment in check. For example, now, the short-term SPY/yields correlation is dumped again. This makes algos and retails to buy every dip on weak datas as those datas will trigger Fed cut (â€œbad news are god newsâ€). Okay, so now letâ€™s jump into todayâ€™s positioningâ€¦ Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# Where does the money go? OpEx pt. 2, Inflation - Intraday post (18/July)

Market analysisWhere does the money go? OpEx pt. 2, Inflation - Intraday post (18/July)For long-term investors too... Distribution, GOLD, BTC, Yields, MMFsJul 18, 2025âˆ™ Paid142ShareHere you can find again the monthly post, breaking down the monthly volatility exposures, inflection points and targets.Yesterdayâ€™s positioning and breakdown, And the inflation call. I said that CPI will set the tone, and PPI and retail sales will confirm the trendâ€¦Now, the problem is that inflation is not muted at all, and the probelm is exactly the wealth effect that this short squeeze rally created. Trump has lower control over the datas than his counters, and he trapped himself. He wanted to mask growth problems so hard, that it made rate cuts unnecessary.CPI showed that inflation is above the target, PPI showed increasing good prices foreshadowing further pass through to customers, and retail sales showed increased spendings. There is no disinflation, while AI-bubble outperforms the DotCom-bubbleFed Funds odds for no cuts went from 39.6% to 47.1%OpEx juices up the volume a bit, but into Monday, after the hedge unwinds, the volume will just turn back to be low, and vol of vol supply will do its job of provide some sort of support for the markets.Momentum is very bullish across the index, sentiment is extremely greedy. BTC and GOLD show topping tail, 115k - 95k supports for BTC (whales are slowly distributing), and 3240 - 2950 for GOLD, but they will go up, as dollar is being beaten, as we are heading towards a new digital economy. Yields are expected to go up to 4.6% - 4.7% and even 5% later. SubscribeThe momentum is bullish for now, profits getting taken, volume is low, and liquidity is unstable. All what you see is mechanical flows and short-term speculative tradings and short squeezes. And Iâ€™m pretty sure that this trend will hold until FOMC, that is my main risk target since May. This is why I keep emphatizing since June 24, that donâ€™t rush to short this market yet. But market needs Powell to comfirm it. If no Fed cut, no yield relief = no cash out of MMFs, meaning no liquidity boost for equities. Market support from shortâ€‘term liquidity evaporates, causing a significant unwind of the current, liquidityâ€‘driven rally. Simply because the liquidity lifeline stays locked into MMFs and Tâ€‘bills. Lower frontâ€‘end yields have been a key catalyst for equity rallies. And this is what the Fed can control, the long-end is owned by the investors. So, as Treasury issuance outstrips MMF absorption capacity, yields will spike, liquidity will decline, and this fake growth rally will unravel. The thing is that since the 2000s the M2 went from 4.7 trln to 21.94 trln USD, while total market value from 13.45 trln to 62.2 trln USD. So it means that excess liquidity has been the primary driver of soaring stock valuations, rather than proportional growth in real economic output. I strongly think that when equities start to fall, BTC will go with them as well, the way it did in April:Money goes from risk assets to safe-havens, then allocate a portion of it into digital assets and some back to legacy markets. And so on. Deposits must be washed slowly out and market needs new home. Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

# "Who's bluffing?" USA vs. China poker game + Intraday post (10/April)

> Digging into the April 9 events

**Date:** unknown

Market analysis"Who's bluffing?" USA vs. China poker game + Intraday post (10/April)Digging into the April 9 eventsApr 10, 2025âˆ™ Paid2622ShareHere comes the continuation of yesterdayâ€™s postâ€¦Iâ€™ll explain what the title refers to. If youâ€™re playing poker against a strong opponent and the stakes keep rising relentlessly, and youâ€™re no longer sure how to read your opponentâ€™s reactionsâ€”how far theyâ€™re willing to goâ€”you might pull off a double feint, which means pretending temporal weakness and watching how your opponent responds. If they also reduce the pressure, thereâ€™s a pretty good chance theyâ€™re just bluffing.However, weâ€™re observing the game from the outside, trying to figure out which player to bet on. Because right now, weâ€™re speculators, not investors. The question, then, is: whoâ€™s bluffing: US or China?Iâ€™m going to explore that topic now, in light of yesterdayâ€™s ~10% run-up.The April 9 twistTrumpâ€™s April 9 tariff policy twist â€“ elevating tariffs on China (especially consumer goods) while delaying or reducing tariffs on other countries â€“ was a deliberate strategic pivot. To understand its implications, we should break down the policy and economic logic.By 2025, China was by far the largest source of U.S. consumer product imports (everything from electronics to apparel to appliances). In prior tariff rounds (2018â€“2019), the Trump administration had often exempted many consumer goods or imposed lower rates, partly to avoid direct pain on U.S. consumers. This time, Trump went all-in, slapping tariffs that reportedly exceeded 100% on a broad swath of Chinese exports. The rationale seemed to be punitive â€“ to pressure China intensely â€“ but it also means U.S. importers and consumers will face sharp price increases on everyday goods. By contrast, tariffs on key allies (Europe, Canada, Japan, etc.) were paused at 10% or avoided entirely for 90 days, giving those countries a chance to negotiate or adjust supply chains.Trumpâ€™s likely calculation was that he could afford to anger China but did not want to completely alienate U.S. allies and U.S. businesses all at once. Itâ€™s a divide-and-conquer approach in the trade war. Crucial.Tariffs on consumer goods are generally inflationary in the short run â€“ they act as a sales tax on imports, raising prices for U.S. buyers. For example, Federal Reserve economists have estimated that a broad 10% tariff on imports could lift core CPI inflation by a few tenths of a percent over the course of a year. In this case, with over $500 billion of Chinese goods facing tariffs potentially above 50-100%, U.S. consumer price indices will see upward pressure as those costs filter through. Indeed, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler noted in early April that some of the recent rise in goods inflation was â€œanticipatoryâ€ of the tariffsâ€™ effect, as businesses and consumers rushed to buy items (like cars and appliances) before higher prices hit.However, while tariffs can create price spikes, they also weaken demand, which can be deflationary down the line. Consumers confronted with significantly higher prices may cut back spending or switch to cheaper alternatives. If real incomes donâ€™t keep up, overall consumption falls. Businesses, seeing higher input costs and potentially lower sales volumes, might reduce investment or hiring. In the broader sense, tariffs act like a tax increase on the economy â€“ sucking purchasing power and potentially leading to demand destruction. Yesterday I wrote that Powell articulated this dilemma: trade tariffs simultaneously slow growth and raise inflation in the short term. The Fed and others feared a stagflationary hit, where the Fedâ€™s usual policy response is complicated (easing helps growth but could stoke inflation, whereas tightening would curb inflation but deepen the slowdown). If policy errs on the side of tightness (to fight tariff-driven inflation), a deeper slump and even deflationary spiral could result once the one-off price boosts fade. By delaying or lowering tariffs on U.S. allies, Trump likely hoped to ease global opposition and cushion the impact on supply chains. Europe, for instance, was given a 90-day reprieve, which European officials welcomed as â€œgood newsâ€ enabling further talks. This means supply routes from Europe, Latin America, and other partners could temporarily substitute for some Chinese imports (where feasible) without incurring tariffs â€“ an intentional pressure tactic against Beijing.However, if companies shift sourcing to avoid Chinese tariffs, it could be less efficient or more costly, still raising prices somewhat. Moreover, this selective approach could distort trade flows: countries not subject to the tariff (say Vietnam or Mexico) might see a surge in demand for their goods, potentially causing bottlenecks or higher prices there. In effect, while the tariff delay for others helps avoid a synchronized price shock on all imports, it doesnâ€™t fully eliminate inflationary pressure â€“ it merely concentrates it on China-exposed supply chains. It also means China bears the brunt of the economic hit among U.S. trade partners, which was precisely Trumpâ€™s intent.By sharply raising import costs on consumer goods, the tariffs could indeed reduce real consumer spending â€“ households might delay purchases or downtrade to cheaper goods, slowing economic activity. If businesses canâ€™t pass on all costs, some may cut margins or lay off workers, adding slack to the labor market. Already, by March 2025 there were signs of disinflation: the Fed noted that progress toward its 2% inflation target had stalled and that underlying inflation measures were not falling. If the trade war induces a recession, the likely trajectory would be an initial bump in inflation (from tariffs) followed by a downturn where demand collapses and prices start to fall. We can look at China as a cautionary example: China entered deflation this year partly because exports weakened amid trade tensions. In March, Chinaâ€™s CPI was down 0.1% year-on-year (a second monthly decline) and producer prices were down 2.5%, with analysts explicitly citing the escalating U.S. trade war and unsold exports as factors driving Chinese prices lower. In effect, China is exporting deflation â€“ its excess supply and lower-cost goods, facing tariffs, either pile up domestically (forcing price cuts) or get diverted globally, pushing prices down elsewhere. For the U.S., tariffs on consumer goods from China mean Americans pay more at the store, unless Chinese firms cut their prices to retain market share.There is some evidence Chinese exporters may have to absorb part of the tariff by lowering prices (to remain competitive), which ironically reinforces deflationary pressure in China and globally. If Chinese firms slash prices by, say, 20% to offset a 100% tariff, U.S. consumers see a 80% net price rise on those goods, but Chinese profit margins collapse â€“ leading potentially to factory layoffs and further deflation in China. That, in turn, can spill back to the U.S. through cheaper intermediate goods or a weaker Chinese yuan.If Trump intended the dramatic tariff announcement followed by a quick partial retreat as a grand bluff to rattle China but then reassure Wall Street, it partially succeeded â€“ he demonstrated he was â€œcrazy enoughâ€ to go nuclear on tariffs, but also that he would blink if markets melted down too far. This could strengthen his hand diplomatically (showing China that the U.S. has emergency mechanisms to buffer its markets, so China shouldnâ€™t assume the U.S. will cave easily). However, itâ€™s a dangerous game: relying on the Fed and markets to cushion self-inflicted shocks undermine long-term confidence from the Middle-Eastâ€™s and Russiaâ€™s part. When the worldâ€™s safest asset (U.S. Treasuries) suddenly behaves unpredictably, it rattles global trust. If big holders like Saudi Arabiaâ€™s SAMA, UAEâ€™s ADIA, or Russiaâ€™s sovereign fund see wild swings and the prospect of U.S. policy driving down the value of their holdings, they may reconsider allocations.China US debt sellingIf China were to retaliate by aggressively selling U.S. Treasuries and ramping up tariffs, the near-term effect would be sharply higher U.S. interest rates, severe stress in financial markets, and a further collapse in bilateral trade. Also Europeâ€™s economy, already stagnating, could tip into deep recession as global trade falls and financial uncertainty spikes.Even the fear of Chinese selling itself is enough to move the market: recall that in early April, â€œmarkets [were] concerned that China and other countries could â€˜dumpâ€™ U.S. Treasuries as a retaliation tool. Hence, UST yields [went] up.â€ We saw yields leap to multi-year highs partly on this concern. If actual dumping occurred, a disorderly surge in yields could result. For example, the 10-year yield could shoot well above 5% or 6% in short order if thereâ€™s no intervention. Such a spike raises borrowing costs across the board â€“ mortgages, car loans, business loans, and government debt â€“ tightening financial conditions dramatically.Highly leveraged funds would face margin calls as bond prices fell, potentially causing some to fail. The U.S. government itself would face sharply higher interest costs; if sustained, this would balloon the federal deficit due to higher debt service, creating a vicious cycle of more borrowing and further upward pressure on yields. In extreme scenarios, this can lead to a self-reinforcing selloff or even questions about U.S. debt sustainability as investors lose confidence. While the U.S. could ultimately rely on the Fed to buy its debt (more on that soon), the interim volatility would be severe.The Federal Reserveâ€™s likely reaction to a massive foreign selloff would be to intervene as a buyer of last resort. This means launching a new round of quantitative easing, explicitly purchasing Treasuries to absorb the supply China (and potentially others) dump. In effect, the Fed would be monetizing the debt to keep yields from spiraling upward. The Fed could also cut interest rates (if not already at zero) to offset tightening. However, these actions have consequences: rapidly expanding the Fedâ€™s balance sheet to counteract a foreign selloff might undermine confidence in the dollar or future inflation. It could be seen as the Fed accommodating fiscal needs (debt financing), potentially denting its inflation-fighting credibility. Yet, not acting is likely worse â€“ if yields spiked uncontrollably, the U.S. economy would crash. So the Fed would almost surely step in, as Bank of England did in 2022 when UK bond yields surged. The question is whether the Fed could buy fast enough to stabilize the market and whether doing so would introduce longer-term inflation risk. This essentially becomes a contest between Chinaâ€™s selling and the Fedâ€™s buying. The Fed, with infinite printing power, can in theory always win, but at the possible cost of devaluing the currency.Howeverâ€¦Selling Treasuries would also impact Chinaâ€™s economy. If it causes the yuan to rise (because selling USD assets tends to push USD down vs yuan), Chinese exports become less competitive at a time they are already hampered by tariffs. Chinaâ€™s central bank could counter by easing monetary policy â€“ cutting interest rates or reserve requirements to stimulate domestic demand â€“ trying to offset export losses with internal growth. They could also impose stricter capital controls to prevent their own firms from taking money out during the turmoil. Additionally, China could accelerate trade with other partners (the EU, ASEAN) to make up for lost U.S. business, although global recession would make that hard. If the confrontation is that severe, China might accept a couple of years of very slow growth or recession as a cost of standing up to the U.S., just as the U.S. would be enduring a recession too. Essentially, itâ€™d be a test of whose system can absorb more pain.(Chinese authorities have more direct control over their economy (state banks, state-owned enterprises, etc.) and could probably maintain stability (e.g., forbid layoffs or use fiscal firepower to keep things running) for some time even in a downturn. Politically, they would cast it as resisting U.S. aggression, which might rally nationalist support despite economic hardship.)The April 9 SpikeBRICS and Middle-East resources say that the dramatic intraday rebound did not represent a healthy rebalancing but rather a â€œcircuit breakerâ€ response engineered by the Fed. They note that while the U.S. ultimately averted a collapse, the market reaction exposed vulnerabilities that could be exploited if shocks recur. Although they emphasize that the U.S. remains fundamentally strong, they have concern over the frequency and intensity of such emergency actions.Beijing increased tariffs selectively and focused on sectors where the impact would signal resolve without triggering runaway instability. The PBOC implemented liquidityâ€‘support measures such as lowering reserve requirement ratios and guiding stateâ€‘owned banks to extend credit in vulnerable export regions. Beijing saw the U.S. episode as a temporary volatility event rather than systemic failure. Chinese experts evaluated the situation and concluded that the Fedâ€™s intervention was a necessary adjustment rather than a reflection of deep structural weakness.The EU and many BRICS members expressed concern over the vulnerabilities exposed by the U.S. crisis. They are reâ€‘evaluating their reliance on the U.S. financial system, with some calling for a more multipolar arrangement in global finance.Trump is seemed as impulsive and hysterical while Xiâ€™s reaction, by contrast, was measured.So, while the Fedâ€™s actions certainly helped to calm the bond market and provided necessary liquidity, they did not amount to a full-blown â€œmonetary easingâ€ package like a rate cut or aggressive quantitative easing program. U.S. policymakers appeared to view the April 9 volatility as a technical market disruption that could be managed with these focused measures.In contrast, Chinese authorities implemented more explicit liquidityâ€‘providing measures. These included lowering the reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) and guiding stateâ€‘owned banks to expand credit in exportâ€‘sensitive sectors. Such measures are textbook examples of monetary easing aimed at supporting domestic demand and stabilizing financial conditions. These moves aim to offset external shocks (like U.S. tariffs and global market volatility) and support domestic demand.Howeverâ€¦Trumpâ€™s strategy marked by (steep tariffs on Chinese imports) directly increases the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S. market. This can hurt export-oriented sectors of the Chinese economy, reducing profits and potentially curbing further investment. When China is relying on monetary easing to stimulate domestic activity, a significant hit to its export revenues can undermine its overall policy effectiveness. Furthermore, aggressive U.S. trade policy may force Chinese companies to accelerate diversification of their supply chains away from the U.S., thereby shortening the window during which monetary easing can generate growth.During periods of global economic retrenchment, countries that excessively eased monetarily without corresponding improvements in trade balances faced capital flight and depreciation pressures. Trump's policies, by intensifying trade friction, may create an environment where Chinaâ€™s easing is insufficient to sustain growth, forcing further aggressive policy measures that could eventually destabilize its financial markets. This would diminish investorsâ€™ confidence in China, and would force China into an even tighter policy cornerâ€”possibly exposing vulnerabilities that it hoped to offset through easing alone.The question is whether Trump dares to take further aggressive steps against his opponent. As mentioned yesterday, the risk/reward doesn't favor him.Back to the initial ideaBut letâ€™s not forget something Iâ€™ve been saying since March:The goal remains a U.S.â€“Russia agreement, which also requires the participation of the globalist elite. The tariffs and all other measures aim, on one hand, to bring the globalist elite to the negotiating table with the U.S. On the other hand, Trump needs to eradicate stagflation from the American economy, which can only be done with drastic stepsâ€”and that requires genuine deflationary fear. This is a dangerous game because, on one hand, foreign investors lose confidence; on the other, the EU is finding new sources for itself with China.Thatâ€™s why Trump, using the double feint we discussed above, is trying to block China, andâ€”if Iâ€™m correctâ€”it seems the bluff is working.Continue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext

Market analysisWhy Sept cut odds are still high? - Intraday post (15/Aug)Debt burden, Treasury issuance, Recession odds, OpExAug 15, 2025âˆ™ Paid141ShareCore PPI come out quite hot confirming sticky inflationary pressures and tariff effects as we expected since April/May. PPI feeds into PCE more directly than CPI. Producer prices, especially trade services margins and core goods, tend to lead consumer inflation with a lag (weeks to a few months).Market is now waiting for the PCE data (Aug 29) but what the market priced in is starting to be realized, stillâ€¦ Why? Because 10 yr is expected to hover ~4.3% because of tariff worries and heavy Treasury supply (elevated term premium). This keeps financial conditions relatively tight even if the Fed trims the policy rate 25bp. Also July NFPâ€¦ Fed repeatedly emphasized balancing risks when the labor side weakens, and tariff pass-through is seen as near-term and mainly in goods, as the charts from the linked post is also showingâ€¦The other problem is that even with a surge in customs receipts, Julyâ€™s deficit still widened ~20% y/y, and Treasury debt is nearing $37T. Treasury supply is heavy but skewed to bills. Because long rates stay firm on supply & term-premium concerns (debt burden and ongoing issuance), a small cut doesnâ€™t over-ease. MMF AUM is still growing. Fed cut would lower MMF yields, which could unlock some money out of cash over time. So, this Sept cut is expected to be a hawkish cut, then more cuts in 2026 as tariff effects start to fade. So the probability of malign outcomes of this August risk window eases, because debt burden must be managed first, and it is shifting towards the post-Sept OpEx/FOMC window, especially because a slow sell-off would ease the wealth-effect caused inflationary pressures, but stay cautious! No long-term positions for me. A market correction is timely, prices are temporaly high. But I donâ€™t see bearish trend now, only high odds for a pullback.

# Window of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tells

Market analysisWindow of Risk, Disbalance - Investigating the story that the market tells"Market has become more fragile than it seems" / Asymmetric drawdown riskSep 18, 2025âˆ™ Paid472ShareEarlier window of risk callsAfter the April crash my primal window of risk was the May ECB rate decision to mid-May (Trump visit to ME) window. We had a ~97 pts decline but the market didnâ€™t broke my target from where the momentum could have shifted to left-tailish. Later, a 124 pts decline materilaized after Trumpâ€™s visit, but it wasnâ€™t the risk I expected, it was strictly derived from the weekly positioning with an exact target. Same as with the June 16-20 week with its 107 pts decline.The next, and basically my (orignial) major window of risk was the July/August window, post-NFP and FOMC period after tariff effects start to appear in the datas. It was clear since April. I marked it into mid-August. They indeed started to appear in the datas, and we got a 215 pts decline, still didnâ€™t broke my target, that would have triggered the left-tail risk that I kept mentioning. Later, mid-August, another 138 pts decline happened, but still didnâ€™t broke the structure.(I add here that it started to be clear for me during mid-July that the market will remain supported, and I emphatized that my window of risk is shifting towards post-Sept OpEx period)The current window of risk is from post-OpEx Tuesday to October buyback window (as 75% of SPX market cap is in blackout by early October, and funds like to de-risk). Before I jump into the reasons, let me tell youâ€¦â€¦what is the problem?Trumpâ€™s first admin produced a market performance of this kind: And the Covid-crash rebound looked like this: As you can see, the post-Covid rebound wasnâ€™t as quick as it looks first. It produced three more than 9% drops. After the 2018 pullback of 20.21% range the market also experienced 6-7% pullbacks that were higher than proportional compared to the Covid-rebound. In both case, they happened in the following 8 months period before taking out the ATH.Proportionally, it would be like if we would have gotten some 5-6% pullbacks after the current 21.35% April crash before taking off the February all-time-high around December/next-January. And because velocity is the ratio between the path and the time, this is why people say, this rebound is simply just too fast. It feels instable for literally anybody because of its velocity and lack of gap-fillings, and retested structure of liquidity.At the first look, you may think that the momentum is heavily imbalanced. But it is not quite true. The purple line shows us the accumulated imbalances:  As you can see, the time correction ate up a significant % of it, but not all of it. The returns are not that overstretched as they may appear on the price chart. Just for comparsion, the Covid-rebound and the 2021 bull run looked like this: The imbalances were moderated pretty fast and were kept on a relatively low level during 2021 using time correction. The Feb-April selloff did nothing momentum wise but took back all the 2024 imbalances when it reached 5901.88, created a sharp negative disbalance that were also rebalanced when it rebound to 5619.08 What I want to say with all of these, is that the market is not as disbalanced as it may first seems. So, the risk that the different mean reversion algorhytms are meassuring, running on the wrong assumptions (moving averages, gaussian z-scores, exponential growth assumptions or different fair value assumptions) misjudge the trend. If momentum is carefully slowed down, the effect of time correction can mitigate all of these risks coming from assumed disbalanced returns. But, the key takeaway here is that, even knowing that the market has relatively more uncorrected disbalance than it was after past crashes, it is at a level that can be easily managed.The risk doesnâ€™t emerge from momentum, it emerges from something elseâ€¦ SubscribeWhat is the risk? The force that pushed this market even higher in this agressive manner is structural flows.My subs know that day after day, week after week, we keep seeing dealers profiles with negative speed exposures, positive vomma and zomma exposures and pricings that collect the premiums from short sellers.Meanwhile the stock-to-bond correlation is sharply positive on the monthly tenor, SPX/VIX beta is also getting longer since the August sell-off, while investor portfolios keep showing outflow into bonds, cash and other safe-havens.The purpose of the concentrated and agressive negative speed profile is to overwrite the growing SPX skew (net longer vanna) since 2024 June (roughly) on the short-run. What it generates is a short-term positively skewed implied distribution, that generates liquidity usually just right below the spot, and creates a less-resistant but more illiquid paths upward, supported by dealer hedging flows. (This is what I like to call as â€œstunt matsâ€ below the spot)We also keep seeing the constant vomma supply, that does nothing but dampens the tailedness of that implied distribution. Doing this by literally making the volatility to rangebound, not letting it to make sharp moves (it does almost the same to volatility, that gamma does to the momentum, hence its other name: â€œvolgaâ€ that is VOLatility + GAmma). What it takes is locally not letting upside gamma squeezes to materialize in a violent fashion, basically producing a â€œbraking-effectâ€ on any upside moves and short squeezes. Also, to the downside it doesnâ€™t let the vanna to wake up the put hedges on different tenors, so those get mostly closed or let to expire worthless, providing further mechanical buyback flows.Zomma is also shifting to positive as we moving upward, that is a clear sign that we have reached the far right wing of the curve. The system is designed to not let volatility to be suppressed or expanded forever, and zomma is the force that can have an ultimate stopping effect on vol if not anything else. (Again, zomma is capping the volatility by braking the momentum because zomma is the relationship between volatility and gamma, so if vol goes up, the upside gammas start to increase, thus as a result the local dealer hedging flow kicks in and swallows most of the volatility and braking down the momentum. Doesnâ€™t necessary stop it, but brakes it downâ€¦ it is the vol expansion/suppression that it is designed to stop through the momentum.) The other structural flow is generated by the agressive volatility suppression: After volatility mean-reverted sharply and too fast (momentum-wise), it was set to rangebound through the constant vomma supply, currently at 9.76%. VIX was shorted down by 76.17% during the past 5 months, that is literally the fastest decline in its record. The short vol trade is a very crowded trade, bidding up gamma into this expiration. CTAs and Vol Controls and any funds that rely on risk parity, increased their exposure mechanically on this rally, as volatility rangebounded with a slight negative drift. However, the agressive fashion of this vol suppression is crucial, because it made these funds near to their 3-yrs average. And this is a huge positional imbalance, because if volatility catches up towards 13.59% (margin of error is 14.13%), the unwind would be asymmetrical as well, while upside is getting exhausted already, from structural flows perspective. Running codes, CTAs wonâ€™t buy into any 1-2% rallies, but if the SPX falls by 1.5 - 2% they will start to decrease the weight of their allocations, slowly. Especially in NDX, that has the leading weight in this momentum. If NDX falls by only 2.15 - 2.5%, CTAs will be triggered to sell. But anyway, in tech they already reached their max allocation, so they decrease the weight anyway. The momentum is overly concentrated into 0DTE flows and AI momentum, especially after August, accumulating concentrated and excess leverage. So, the disbalance is not emerging directly from the nature of the market momentum, but from the momentum of the volatility reversion and the positioning it generated. Even a small spike that vomma â€œcannot handleâ€ (because vomma has a net inverse relationship with volatility), could trigger a violent drawdown. I give levels belowâ€¦ SubscribeWhat is the story that the market wants to tell us?Market cannot always be frontrunned. During the past months, all I could do is to meassure the risk, derive trigger levels and adjust my longer-term portfolio strategy. The April drawdown was clear as sun, after I decoded what was the meaning behind the February slow selloff.Now, all what we are seeing is that the market is agressively held for any price, pushed further and further up, hunting short squeeze triggers of funds, agressive vol supply, and so onâ€¦ on what? On the narrative of Fed cut that would unlock MMF money to support growth and to manage debt burden. The admin must have built a goldilocks narrative around this economy in order to mask the obvious stagflation and future inflation risk. (Debt burden is way more dangerous.)The story behind the February-April selloff was to bleed-out opponents from the tech sector and to provide discount prices for the Middle-Eastern investors and Trumpâ€™s circle. The market is planned to be reset on a Web3 basis into 2028/30 latest, and until then it will be accelerated, and inflation will be pushed up. I heard from higher government circles and Middle-Eastern investment fund circles that they all plan to trigger a crisis around that period in order to reallocate money into the new economic systemâ€¦ if everything goes along the plan between the USA-RUS and Middle-East, without EU intercepting it. I already elaborated on this in my AI-Bubble post. Okay, but this is the longer-term picture, painting us a prolonged bull market on tech, inflation, gold and yieldsâ€¦But what about now? Who is interested to agressively hold the market up with hightened risk, elevated spot/vol beta, high leverage and very asymmetric positioning? Because it all looks tooâ€¦ directâ€¦Well, I kept emphatizing since April, that this market is not investorâ€™s market but traderâ€™s market. Investors have no confidence on this leg up, they slowly derisking. The April sell-off was also mostly caused by them (weighing machine).All the buy-the-dip flow was speculative buying flow, simply to generate extra money on this leg-up, but also keeping the risk high after some point (the first 80%+ risk signal appeared in July for me). And because of the risk growing, most funds simply scaling out of those positions, that the insiders can accumulate slowly, while they generate enough money for a buyback lower later. 1) funding markets gapping (SOFR > IORB for days, heavy SRF usage), 2) UST market depth collapsing / big bid-ask, 3) primary credit issuance shutting, 4) systematic-strategy de-lever triggers (CTA/vol-control) and 0DTE flows amplifying intraday moves, 5) broad de-risking in flows6) Buyback at discount, gaining more power in those sectorsThis is the scheme. Only thing needed is a trigger. Trump has deals to announce slowly, and AI cap-ex boom, to push some more legs higher and to keep any drawdown under check, sentiment-wise. Mark this trend line, as it is something that matters pretty much: PCE on Sept 26, CPI on Oct 15, or further growing unexpected weakness in labor markets all can be triggers for example for a 6-10% pullback to take back the â€œFed cut - hypeâ€ returns.As the economic management is already known, it would be my very solid and confident buy the dip move for the next 3-5 years.

This is the monthly setup. As you can see, market is set to vol selling. VIX declined by 6.32% during the week, and realized volatility is also ranging as it is expected â€œhigher for longerâ€, through vomma supply: As you know, I high conviction long GOLD for months now. Trumpâ€™s inflationary policy, dollar devaluation, inflation risk, coming hawkish cut and artificial stimulus provides a long-term upward pressure on gold. Every dip will be bought in the 3350/60 area. Below this, I will be a bit more patient watching the momentum, but gold is a long-term investment.With buying bonds, I wait now (european gov bonds), because after the debt burden eases a bit, inflation will be revealed, and thatâ€™s when I expect better bond yields than now.  SubscribeIâ€™m still not a long-term buyer on SPX. I wait for the pullback to play out. It will eventually, the risk is still above 80%For now, I go week by week until, watching the levels and structures I share behind the paywall. They give us nice opportunities for short-term directional bets.  Market should produce 6543.51 in avg over the next five days in order to keep the positive disbalance.

Market analysisZomma & vomma risk as a response to macro, Weekly post (19-23/May)May 18, 2025âˆ™ Paid4436ShareWe have a lot of Fed speakers and PMI (thursday) and VIX expo this coming week. May OpEx was supportive, and for me this still seems topish. Even more.My reversion model shows 77.94% probability for a reversal towards 5518.31 (lvl that stil wouldnâ€™t be trendchanging, but would confirm bullish trend and build the structure for a longer time frame; like monthly), closer to my target of 80%+. I would still maintain day by day approach, and take longer dated short once the reversion model goes above 80%. Q3 looks very bearish to me. Before I delve into fundamental explaination, let me share you something very important:coded rolling SPX/VIX beta As you can see, since May 5, the beta has spiked. The key is the sudden steep spike, not the current beta value itself. Remember, what SPX did on those days? - There were two days, were SPX corrected back a bit. Then it suddenly was saved by gov speakers, and squeezed up more. The beta is still negative, but went longer (jargon for â€˜more positiveâ€™/â€™less negativeâ€™). So, on that SPX pullback VIX still went down, but when SPX started to rally, the VIX decline started to slow down in an accelerating manner. This happens when the whole smirk gets bid, including the tails too. Now, this, considering the very cheap IV relative to RV, tells me that short vol trade is oversold. And not simply oversold, but aggresively. Market reached a point, where there start to be liquidity problems to the upside, and this is important bcs during this aggressive vol selling, the market accumulated significant zomma and vomma riskâ€¦ SubscribeContinue reading this post for free, courtesy of Alma.Claim my free postOr purchase a paid subscription.PreviousNext
