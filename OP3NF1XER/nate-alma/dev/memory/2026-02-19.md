## OpenClaw Update to v2026.2.17

User requested update from v2026.2.9 to v2026.2.17 after seeing release announcement.

### Update Process (Railway deployment)

Standard `openclaw update` didn't work - needed manual process:

1. **Clean git state**
   - Had uncommitted package.json changes from dependency updates
   - Ran `git reset --hard HEAD` to clean

2. **Fetch and checkout**
   - `git fetch --tags` to get v2026.2.17 tag
   - `git checkout v2026.2.17` (detached HEAD is fine)

3. **Install deps and build**
   - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
   - `pnpm build` (required - binary runs from /openclaw/dist/entry.js)
   - Build took ~2 minutes (TypeScript compilation)

4. **Restart gateway**
   - Found PID with `ps aux | grep openclaw-gateway`
   - `kill -TERM <pid>` to restart

### New Features in 2026.2.17
- Sonnet 4.6 (newer model)
- 1M context (vs 200k)
- Chat-based subagent spawning
- Styled inline buttons on Telegram

### Notes
- Railway deployment runs from installed binary, not systemd
- Gateway pairing issues during process (normal during updates)
- Update restarts gateway automatically but may need manual restart after build
