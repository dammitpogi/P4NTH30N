## Multi-Model Architecture Project

Nate hit Claude API rate limits and wants to redesign the system:

**Goals:**
- Provider cascade (auto-fallback when rate-limited)
- Task routing to different agents with different LLMs
- Named agents matching their roles (not just "Dash")
- Cost efficiency - save Opus for complex work

**Key insight:** Nate troubleshot with ChatGPT (copying code between chats), then asked Opus to fix/update OpenClaw - and it worked in one message. Wants to leverage both models' strengths.

**OpenClaw supports this natively:**
- `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` for cascade
- `agents.list[]` for multiple named agents with different models
- `bindings` for routing channels/groups to agents
- Can share workspace across agents or isolate

**Proposed architecture:**
| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Dash | Sonnet | Daily chat, routine |
| Coder | Opus | Complex coding, debugging |
| Scout | GPT-4o | Research, web, external APIs |

**Next steps:** Waiting on Nate's direction - simple fallback, add OpenAI, or full multi-agent setup.

**Docs reference:** `/openclaw/docs/concepts/multi-agent.md`, `model-failover.md`, `model-providers.md`
