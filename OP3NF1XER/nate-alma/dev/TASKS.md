# Tasks

## Active

- Keep Telegram group behavior open (`requireMention: false`) and monitor regression.
- Continue multi-model architecture rollout (fallback + named agent routing).
- Prepare Discord integration path.
- Mature trading pipeline support (SPY/SPX/ES/XSP/VIX/VVIX) and setup-readout workflow.
- Build Mac mini node integration path (pairing + calendar/reminders/iCloud phase).

## Done

- Migrated deployment-project artifacts from `dev` into `deploy/_from-dev-cleanup-2026-02-24` with full move manifest.
- Built and documented Nate profile corpus for agent guidance (`CLAUDE.md`, `USER.md`).
- Captured and operationalized recurring Nate chat-log requests into deterministic tooling references.
