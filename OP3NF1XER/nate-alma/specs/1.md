Here are **free (or free-tier) add-ons** that tend to make a trading-help agent *way* more useful than “general web search,” especially on a low-cost personal deployment.

## High-leverage free additions

### 1) Paper-trading execution loop (so the agent can *test* ideas)

If your friend can use a broker-style API, **Alpaca paper trading** is genuinely useful for an agent: place orders, track positions, simulate fills, and generate “what would’ve happened” reports. Alpaca’s docs state paper trading is **free and available to all users**. ([Alpaca API Docs][1])

**Why it helps:** lets your OpenClaw agent validate signals with a consistent execution model instead of “advice-only” chat.

### 2) Macro/regime context (FRED)

Use the **FRED API** to pull interest rates, CPI, unemployment, credit spreads proxies, etc. It’s designed for programmatic retrieval of economic data. ([FRED][2])

**Why it helps:** a lot of trading mistakes come from ignoring macro regime shifts; this gives the agent an always-available, structured source.

---

### 3) SEC filings + “what changed” diffs (EDGAR)

For US equities, add an EDGAR ingestion tool: fetch latest 10-K/10-Q/8-K, extract sections, and have the agent summarize **material changes** vs prior filing.

The SEC provides official EDGAR API resources for accessing submissions and extracted data. ([SEC][3])

**Why it helps:** beats noisy news; “new risk factors / guidance changes / going concern language” are exactly what an agent can flag reliably.

---

### 4) Free, broad news stream you can filter yourself (GDELT)

GDELT is a **free/open** global news dataset with query and analysis options. ([GDELT Project][4])

**Why it helps:** lets you build “event radar” (company, sector, keyword) without paying for a premium news API—then your agent can rank items by relevance.

---

### 5) Historical price data for backtests/research (Stooq)

Stooq provides **free historical market data** (downloadable; often CSV-based). ([Stooq][5])

**Why it helps:** your agent can do quick historical checks (“how often did this setup work on this ticker/sector?”) without burning real-time API calls.

---

## If you still want an API-style market data feed (free-tier reality check)

* **Finnhub** has a free tier and includes things like **earnings calendar** endpoints. ([Finnhub][6])
* **Alpha Vantage** free tier is *very* limited: the company itself states **up to 25 requests/day**, and the free rate is commonly noted as **5/minute**. ([Alpha Vantage][7])

**Implication:** for an agent, you’ll want **aggressive caching** + “only fetch when needed,” otherwise free tiers become painful fast.

---

## What I’d prioritize for your build (most value per bandwidth)

1. **Alerts engine** (price/volume/volatility + filing/news triggers)
2. **Paper-trade validation** (even if execution stays manual) ([Alpaca API Docs][1])
3. **EDGAR diffs + summarization** ([SEC][3])
4. **Macro context via FRED** ([FRED][2])
5. Add SearXNG later only if you still feel “web retrieval” is a blocker (it often ends up being less reliable than structured feeds on cloud IPs).
