# Strategist Synthesis Provocation Hardening (2026-02-25)

Decision link: `DECISION_135`

## Why

Nexus requested stronger synthesis and journal outcomes that fully use captured creative detail and produce provocative narrative impact.

## What Changed

- Strategist source-of-truth now enforces a provocative narrative contract for synthesis.
- Journal and speech now have separate quality gates.
- Synthesis now requires an explicit audit gate before marking completion.

## Canonical Artifacts

- `C:/Users/paulc/.config/opencode/agents/strategist.md`
- `STR4TEG15T/memory/decision-engine/SYNTHESIS_PROVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- `STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/DECISION_135_STRATEGIST_SYNTHESIS_PROVOCATION_AND_JOURNAL_HARDENING.md`

## Reusable Learning

- Provocative synthesis quality improves when dramatic structure is explicit and evidence constraints are non-negotiable.
- Journal-first flow materially improves synthesis coherence and factual fidelity.
