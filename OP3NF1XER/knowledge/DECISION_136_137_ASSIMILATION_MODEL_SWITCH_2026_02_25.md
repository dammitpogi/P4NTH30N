# DECISION_136 + DECISION_137 Assimilation Delta (2026-02-25)

## Decision Links

- `STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/DECISION_136_OPENCLAW_EXTERNAL_CODEBASE_AUDIT_KICKOFF.md`
- `STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/DECISION_137_NATE_SUBSTACK_TEACHINGS_CAPTURE_AND_SEARCH.md`

## Assimilated Truth

- DECISION_136 sets the external audit posture: no fiction, evidence-first, and explicit Alma Ease / Nate Expansion criteria.
- DECISION_137 packages doctrine and tooling delivery, then hardens deployment verification with route-kind checks.
- Runtime model-switch claims are untrusted without explicit config mutation plus gateway restart evidence.

## Implemented Hardening

- Added workspace skill `openclaw-model-switch-kit` with deterministic pre-audit -> apply -> restart -> post-audit flow.
- Added workspace AGENTS guidance that forbids claiming model switch success without mutation and restart evidence.
- Added reusable pattern `OP3NF1XER/patterns/OPENCLAW_MODEL_SWITCH_AUDIT_LOOP.md`.

## Query Anchors

- `openclaw model switch pre audit post audit`
- `anthropic opus sonnet haiku config restart`
- `decision 136 alma ease nate expansion`
- `decision 137 doctrine package route kind`
