# Strategist Beast-Mode Hardening (2026-02-24)

Decision link: `DECISION_134`

## Why

Strategist needed stronger control for failing/high-variance projects and upcoming external OpenClaw inspection maintained by Alma.

## What Changed

- Source-of-truth strategist policy expanded with deterministic decision-engine phases.
- External codebase inspection mode added with Alma/OpenClaw interoperability guidance.
- Auditability contract hardened around explicit evidence spine and contradiction handling.
- Efficiency guardrails added (bounded consultation rounds, skeleton-first strategy).
- Self-maintenance loop added (retrospective and automation promotion each substantial pass).

## Canonical Artifacts

- `C:/Users/paulc/.config/opencode/agents/strategist.md`
- `STR4TEG15T/memory/decision-engine/DECISION_ENGINE_BEAST_MODE_PROTOCOL.md`
- `STR4TEG15T/memory/decisions/DECISION_134_STRATEGIST_BEAST_MODE_HARDENING_AND_EXPANSION.md`

## Reusable Learning

- Strategy quality improves when phase boundaries are explicit and closure evidence is required by contract.
- External AI-maintained code inspections need explicit separation between verified facts and inferred assumptions.
